"Bemishal has quickly adapted to working in the organization, despitebeing from a non-telecom background. She has been quick to understandthe product (m-pesa) and has demonstrated understanding of the businessand its applications. A keen mind and positive attitude along withperseverance has helped her get started.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Tie up with a Microfinance company that will also help acquireVodafone customers has been a key closure. This will be the first SMEclosure for ANE and will prove to be a key differentiatorMisses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:She has to get involved in the CSE piece that she has not been able totill now. A CSE RnR and ranking is a must. For this she has to interactwith the local teams and try meeting with CSEs.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Bemishal has been quick to figure out solutions as per requirements.Best example is how she quickly on boarded the cafeteria merchantinitially and also has shown progress in dealing with the new vendor.She has gained trust with the clients by addressing their problems onpriority and by giving quick solutions. She demonstrated this whendealing with the B2C client who was initially not willing to continueworking with us, but is now the best account.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Bemishal needs to drive her agenda more by working closely with theBDMs more. She needs to push her priorities more, especially since thebusiness is in its infancy.Specific Focus on Way Forward:She needs to priortize and prepare her funnel for bulk accounts. Thesame has to be integrated and updated in a tracker so that she hascomplete visibility on the same. She should also demand more resourcesavailable so that she stays on top of all developments.She should now start delivering on bulk accounts starting with fewsmall accounts and then scaling up."

"APD:Ramendra has done well in mpesa. He has shown his commitment to achievehigher results.Ramendra has done well on alternate channel and has been among the topfive nationally. Agent appointment and appointment of ED channel aheadof curve was a major achievement. Circle has empowered the retailer andcustomer through automation of processes for agent location finding andagent settlement. And overall mix of the business was fair acrosssegments.Ramendra has been ambitious in setting up alternate channel and hasdeployed 14 EDs and 226 agents, which have helped growth of transactionvalue. He has engaged well with these guys to improve productivity /agent and training of these channel partners have helped in achievingthe right transactional mix. Engagement with the distribution team atfrontline has helped in improving the UTA and UAA performance. Projecton ADVMS has helped in development of Mpesa in these corridors.Ramendra has not been able to achieve the transaction through puttargets. At the same time UU performance has been below DB. As regardsdevelopment of eco-system for mpesa is concerned, Ramendra has not beenable to add more B2B / B2C / merchants in the circle, this would havehelped circle in achieving big shift target.Ramendra's engagement and ability to influence decision making withcross functional teams like sales and marketing has resulted inunder-achievement of acquisition and UU targets, which in turn resultedin lower achievement of transactional value targets. Further projectslike red hills did not take off, which resulted in lack of eco-systemfor taking up the mpesa. His distribution while at UAA and UTA levelhas done well, the distribution rigor and hygiene leaves much to bedesired.He needs to improve his skills to influence key stake holders, whichwould not only help him improve mpesa business but will also himdevelop as good professional.MYPD:Ramendra has done well in mpesa. He has shown his commitment to achievehigher results.Ramendra has done well on alternate channel and transation value byachieving 153% of the target. UAA and UTA of the circle has been doingwell. Circle has empowered the retailer and customer through automationof processes for agent location finding and agent settlement.Ramendra has been ambitious in setting up alternate channel and hasdeployed 9 EDs and 185 agents, which have helped growth of transactionvalue. He has engaged well with these guys to improve productivity /agent and training of these channel partners have helped in achievingthe right transactional mix. Engagement with the distribution team atfrontline has helped in improving the UTA and UAA performance.Ramendra has not been able to achieve the customer acquisition and agentexpansion targets. At the same time UU performance has been below DB.Further while the circle is above DB on transaction value, it's shorton Big Shift target. As regards development of eco-system for mpesa isconcerned, Ramendra has not been able to add more B2B / B2C / merchantsin the circle, this would have helped circle in achieving big shifttarget.Ramendra engagement with cross functional teams and involvement of crossfunctional teams in achieving mpesa agents appointment and acquisitionhas resulted in performance below DB. The team lacks analytical skillsand working in coordination with marketing which resulted in low UUperformance. At the same time, Ramendra's understanding of consumerneeds and as a result, development of eco-system to meet the consumerneeds have impacted the overall growth of mpesa in circle. Mpesa UKproject, which was purely made on building mpesa as differentiator inthe market, was not executed at all.Going forward, Ramendra need to work closely with other verticals atCircle, not only in terms target sharing, but also in terms of mutualunderstanding on business requirement. He need to work on making mpesaa big differentator in UK, while the project has been conceived, it isyet to see execution on the ground. Further, best practices like SBICSP, ADVMS as Mpesa Hubs need to be executed with perfection on theground to get good mileage on the ground.He needs to improve his analytical skills, which will help himunderstand the retail and customer segmentation, which in turn willhelp in identifying the engagement drivers for both of them, whichshould help the circle increase extraction on mpesa."
"Angshuman had a very good run for the year 14-15 m pesa Cs processeswere lead from the front and each area / parameter was seamlesslystitched as and when required. The platform migration was managed verysmoothly with virtually zero escalations or senior managementinterventions, what ever was faltering in H1 like the CPS also gotcorrected in H2 with rigour and all of this resulted in the m pesASCORE CARD being no 2 in the country. Angshuman has done this thruadoption of through product process knowledge, strong integration withcross verticals and maintaining tight governance. The biggestachievement has been the ability to make a complete turn around fromthe earlier state and has been a very very sincere student who made allpossible amendments over the past mistakes. He has been very positivethroughout the year and has shown ample confidence in self plus builtin a team which can sustain any upscale in business or for that matterchange also. Has been displaying the qualities of simplicity and trustat various junctures. His contribution to CS forte Is noteworthy . H2has witnessed him travelling across branches which is a welcomeinitiative and should be continued. Built in good visibility with thecircle leadership team though the corporate connect still needsimprovement. Has been far more vocal and polished compared to earlieryear but has to continue in this journey and establish more repo withother circle peers as well as corporate m pesa vertical.Angshuman needs to invest now into the interaction quality at inbound CCfor m pesa as well as can improve on the initiatives and connect withcustomers thru outbound. This has been a miss in the current year andan area of opportunity. The CO is a work force which needs morevisibility as well as rigour and display of their utility to thebusiness is what can be worked upon. This can be done by doingstructured reviewes with the m pesa team as well as connecting withthem regularly and putting them into use on the circle business askover and above their critical role of audits. The tracking of closelooping of these audits can be the mechanism to optimally utilize thiswork force.Angsuhman has to invest time into distribution aspect and should walk upand take a project on same which shall be the ladder for his careeraspiration of being a business head for m pesa. He has to take thisinitiative along with SLT facilitation and now that the BAU is veryvery stable should work fast paced into this direction. Is also capableof handling larger circle ops for m pesa given the option of mobilityor a corporate connect. Has to be more vocal and proactive incontribution in the concerned forums so that the decision makersunderstands his think tank abilities and capabilities"

He managed the platform 2.0 launchvery well - and also assumed the responsibility of CS head as well (asCS head was not in the system) and co-ordinated internally as well aswith corporate for a smooth and successful launch. He established andnurtured good interpersonal relations with BDMs and other crossfunctional stakeholders.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):A very close work and proactive approach with key sales functions(distribution/retail) would have helped to deliver better performanceon customer acquisition and agent participation (UAA/UTA). Similarly -anticipating disruptions post new platform launch - agent appointmentsshould have been planned well.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Now that he knows the intricacies and nuances of Mpesa business verywell - he is expected to improve the customer acquisition, agentappointment and participation performance rapidly. At the same time -aggressive and rapid expansion of alternate channel with planned EDappointments will build further momentum on money transfer front. Awell planned and co-ordinated launch of Insta platform for variousutilities will ensure better relevance and so participation fromdistribution as well as retail channel.Progress on Development Goals:While he has shown improvements on influencing and negotiation skills -he needs to continue the journey as these skill sets being extremelycritical in new businesses like Mpesa. Similarly - a continuous focuson improving visibility with key stake holders will put him in theright orbit for future growth.Progress on Career Aspirations:Nihar has been an asset for new business like Mpesa.

Ensured 100% compliance on vendor process carried out by complianceofficer8. New system 2.0 migration was done successfully, with 100% systemtesting for CRM, MPOS, and the new platform and portals are workingfine.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:1. Document rejections have been a constant challenge at all stages-A1,A2 & Bank and continue to remain so.2. KYC has been inconsistent3. Doc processing TATs have never been met till current month.4. 5 S planned to implement in all DHQs to help organizeflow and processing of mpesa docs not completed for all zones.5. Documentation management process benchmarking with best performingcircles could have helped us implement certain practices improvisingTATs and rejection.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Anuradha is high on interpersonal skills. She has been working incoordination of other functional heads to drive her SLs at all touchpoints this has helped her achieve CC values and complaint resolution.Since H1 feedback, Anuradha has been extensively engaging with retail,Softage and DHQs and traveling to zones to personally monitoractivities in the stores and training store staff, including Data entryteam to check documentation pendency.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Mpesa being a new business, continuous evolution of business processes,leading to change in KPI values resulted in Anuradha taking some timeto control the operations and service practices at all ends. She hadbeen grappling to proactively anticipate and address the issues. Shehas also struggled to establish herself as an authority in mpesa incircle and took time to drive the business impacting KPIs across zones.Proactive circle benchmarking of better performing circles for some bestpractices/ processes would have helped her institutionalize therequired changes on time. In last quarter she has been continuouslydriving zones, retail, DHQs and is trying to find out good practicesand solutions, however the impact is yet to be observed. To reduce docprocessing issues at DHQs, it was planned that we should implement 5Sacross zones. This initiative also did not take place beyond one zone.Specific Focus on Way Forward to Improve Mpesa performanceAnuradha has initiated zone visits, retail/DHQ audits since last quarterwhich she needs to continue with rigor to extract desired results. Sheneeds to make a timeline based plan to capture key priorities and workon them with immediate effect.Execution and implementation skills to drive values and processes inthe field.She needs to regularly audit all the A2 points, retail outlets ( 100%coverage per quarter) to identify and fix document related issues.Prioritizing the least performing zones.She needs to understand the best practices of the best performingcircles and replicate without any further delay as we have alreadymissed the major business impacting KPIs.Drive Mpesa App promotion amongst internal and external customersOrganize internal mpesa support desk to improve conviction and use bydemystifying on benefits and ease of using mpesa.Implement 5 S in all A2 / Retail points within next two quarters toorganize Mpesa business.Add more pace and speed to her actions on ground to take a quickcontrol of all missed KPIs.Proactively organize Mpesa service reviews with all stakeholders,including Mpesa head and ZHs to bring focus and desired attention toservice deliverables.To strive and take PB/HP Mpesa amongst the best performing circle (Min Top 5) in the next quarter."

"Overall Comment on the employeeRajesh effort in establishing Mpesa business in the first year of launchis noteworthy. He ensured all the activities during the launch phaseright from agent appointments are done as planned & in the sameintensity across all zones. He also ensured that all the best practicesof other circles are implemented in TN with speed & commitment. Rajeshhas personally driven the alternative channel & bulk business & madesignificant progress in both the areas. He has cracked the first largeenterprise account (GK dairy) in the country with substantial revenueopportunity. Customer acquisition, UU objectives & KYC achievement arefew large misses during the year.What Hits?1. First circle to achieve 100% agents target in the country.2. Model village concept which helped him to showcase success to thezones.3. Bulk business focus helped to first enterprise account in the country(GK Dairy).4. Transaction value achievement in line with BB target5. Migrant location activities to drive money transfers.6. Excellent launch phase which helped him to gain visibility & share ofmind.7. Innovation in branding in GT outlets & retail.8. Specific GTM approach in each zones basis potential & needs of thezones ( Mobile vans /Local connect programs)9. Bulk business focus to achieve one Cr transaction value10. 2 times region star wins out of the 3 declared results as on 3rdqtr.What's Miss?1. RTT & UU target not met.2. Gap in KYC, UTA & Activating agents goals.3. CSE productivity & governance not in line with the objectives.4. Execution of meeting of mind project on MpesaHow Hits?Rajesh focused on FIRST RIGHT approach from the day one & this helpedhim to get all his acts right from the day one. The discipline ofappointing right agent in right village /market /location & potentialhelped the circle to have uniform spread of agents. He & his teamensured training needs are met across all relevant locations & createdright ambiance & awareness within the organization to gain the rightshare. He focused on building alternative channels & on B2B businesswhich helped him to grow Revenue month on month. The Model villageconcept helped him to show case the right model & approach to partners& our internal team members.Rajesh constantly innovated new tools & picked up the learnings fromother circles to make on going corrections. He invested in buildingcapability of his team at regular intervals & constantly engaged withthe distribution & retail teams in the zones.How Miss?Lack of CSE Governance & lower productivity led to lower achievementof RTT &KYC targets month on month. The Retail Store executiveproductivity was also not uniform across zones & the problem aggravatedwith lower participation of VMS/ADVMS partners in the drive. Rajesh& team could have done much better on CSE governance in the first fewmonths of the launch. This gap has led to missing the DB targets onRTT, KYC & UTA.The concept of alternative channel picked up only in 2nd half of theyear & this also led to further gap in meeting the monthly acquisition& UU targets ."

This vertical was new for him butthen he tried his best to get on the top this vertical and startedrunning at decent speed at par with other veteran circles.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Satish struggled a bit when some new initiatives are to be taken, whenhe has to display accountable leadership to take team along in newerterrain for innovating something new or a replicating from other's bestpractices. He needs good amount of supervision and help to get thingsdone in his own vertical. Some of the BDMs and prepaid front line teamtook short cuts to achieve results. He failed to create propergovernance/mechanism and an environment of trust, integrity andfairness within the team. As regards to speed of execution, he needs todrive speed to market better than today. He must relentlesslyprioritize and pursue the outcomes that matter to our business agnosticto the fact that which department is going to help him or enable him.Specific Focus on Way Forward:This year, for AP&T to deliver more than 300% growth in Transactionrevenue, Satish will have to focus on following;Own up the mpesa vertical. Drive end-to-end initiatives for thisvertical. Influence the cross functional team driving on-groundexecution.Work very closely with local marketing team and zonal heads.Focus on UU % increase target should be to increase it by 250% and KYCbase by 100%This year instead of mere width increase, focus should be more onincreasing the participation from existing RTT agents and convertingthem into UTO, UAO.Alternate channel revival and personal owning up by DLs, BDMs n BH/ZHsCapitalize on Utility Payments, Convenience, Travel & Entertainment,Food, Large Format Retail.

Though the SIP visibilitygot created across circles, yet we have missed the deadlines in most ofthe time which requires constant follow ups5. ED model has done well, yet the individual contribution in driving EDmodel was missing. The pro-active approach and tweaking the model tosuit the market requirements was completely missing. For eg. The ED ROIis becoming an issue as MD's were not able to find the ROI attractiveleading to churn.

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Jaipaul has done well in specific markets like Kannur and Calicut in thempesa operations along with his team members. The year of launch hasbeen a challenge interms of doing the budgeted revenue and customeradditions.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Kannur and Calicut markets have a done wonderful delivery on mpesaduring the year. The overall performance has been sketchy and it tookalmost 10 months to close out agent additions. So hits have been lowagainst expectations .Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Mpesa revenue not met is one of the biggest miss against target ( bigbet target was beyond reach thereby). The other major miss has been theability to retain the BDM's ( who were picked to be the best CSM atthat point of time). Corridor markets plan was well made butimplementation and delivery has been a clear miss. Retail focus andsuccess to partner the delivery of customer additons has not been uptothe potential .

The AD markets started contributing to 20% fo thethroughput and over 15% of customer registration.He had driven the Retail team by focusing on VMS as Money transfer hubs. Enabling the team to work on promoting Money transfer - mainly P2Bafter banking hours have resulted in Retail contributing to 35% inCircle throughput andHe has been engaging with the BDMs and MDL to expand and establish theMumbai ROB corridor AT South Coastel zone and partial places at GK.He was very successful in engaging with the zonal teams to driveMalamaal - an RnR for focus areas of mpesa among allverticals-Distribution, Retail and Alternate channel. It is now a verysought after property amongst the zonal team. This has resulted in ahigh performance from all stake holders in the Zones.He has set up the MIS team and put a calendar and trackers to monitorzonal performance. He has been supporting in preparing the annual DBbreaksups, 5+7 and AOPs and prepares most of the reports sought byCentral team. He has always been strictly adhereing to timelines andquality of the reports.He has worked with DAM/BDM/BMs in the field very closely and helped themand provided them with adequate support by pursuing the growth in bothcontributing agents and stable agents. This has boosted the performancespecially from the Distribution team.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:The Big shift target - cud achieve 80% of the Big Shift Target. The DBtargets for UAA and UTA was a miss although the effort was to get pastwhich shows that the Circle is much above NATIONAL Average in both theparameters. Also quality of registration was not in line with DB - aswe measure it through subsequent month retention of active users andalso through KYC %.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Although he tried to drive DB on UAA and UTA through foucssed approachby providing the top/bottom approach and inclusion of Distribution KBIsin RnR the second half of the year saw a decline . In terms ofdocument flow there was an area of improvement on both TAT and qualitywhere KYC % was a miss.Specific Focus on Way Forward:While we are focussing on agent appointments and CSP appointments weneed to drive extraction in a large way from AD markets. Although Amithave just started driving it he needs to clearly focus on gettingrightful extraction from Rural markets by firstly putting all ADs asRTT and then having a minimum of 5 plus agents under each AD. Also nowthat we have to get the Agent footprint right and intense on thecorridor tehsils he needs to startegise and put forward a 3 months roadmap to onboard agents at all identified corridor markets at a 3Xintensity than the rest of the places.He needs to put a weekly governance and process to monitor documentsreceipt within TAT and a monthly target of revival of agents who willgive sustainable business.Progress on Development Goals:Amit is displaying more on using analysis to make more informed andspecific decisions when it comes to short term tactical plans. He needsto do the same into seeing the long term objective which will help himto come out with way forwards to build a sustainable and steadybusiness.Progress on Career Aspirations:Amit is a very aggressive and ambitious resource and need to extendhimself further on doing innovative customer centric activities andcreate an environment wherein customer adoption becomes the key focusarea.

"Overall Appreciation for performance for the year :Saugata has been a model BDM in his erstwhile role in the first 5 monthsin MALDA where he created a sustained agent network and alternate MDsetup and also has been a front runner for Mpesa business for theentire branch providing support and direction to all stakeholders inthe branch.After his movement to Circle as a MDL he has taken the alternate channelto a greater height by increasing the contribution from Alternatechannel although he has to go a long way in developing the overallMpesa eco system through online/offline merchant and enrollingenterprise and other business entities.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Saugata in his first 6 months have overachieved targets from alternatechannel for his branch and have delivered 96% throughput target for theoverall branch. He has met his Distribution targets both for thebranch and for the Circle as a MDL.He has put 7 new EDs for the in his role as MDL along with therespective BDMs of the branches.Customer registrations grew from 17% to 30% from Alternate channel andthe throughput grew from 26% in Sept to 36% in Feb.He has put up 125 RTT SBI CSP and have started getting 89 lacs ofthroughput from this channel. He has worked hand in hand with BDMs toestablish 3 corridors - Murshidabad - Kerala corridor , Golibar(Mumbai)- Medinipur/howrah corridor and the Nadia - Coochbihar corridor as aintra state corridor.He has steered the team of BDMs and other zonal resources insuccessfully launch of the new m-pesa platform both being a part of warroom and also spent considerable amount of time at zones/brancheshelping the teams.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):In his stint as BDM, Malda he has built a robust network of agents andalternate MDs . He has groomed them well and made each of the agentsproductive. He has hand picked few agents and groomed them into Moneytransfer outlets so much that they have started delivering like anyFINO/ECO agents do. He has focussedly driven the Money transfer leaguesnot only from the alternate channel in his branch but to a large extentthrough the VMS'.He had a good CSE governance and engagement programe in his branch whichhelped to increase the productivity of each of them and help achievethe targets for the branch.He had collaborated with both Distribution team and Retail team in thebranch well and that helped others to invest time and efforts in thisnew business. He set up a model village in Malda .In his role as a MDL he is sharing his best practice with the BDMs andhelping them to achieve for their respective branches. To a greatextent he has kept the entire team of BDMs focused on their Daily runand supported them to set up the MD AND Agent network including the SBICSPs. This has helped to increase the contribution from alternatechannel from 17% to 36%.Saugata has initiated the Murshidabad - Kerala corridor and have put ina lot of on ground efforts like awareness campaigns by doing weeklymeet and connect through Skype at the sender end from Murshidabad andset up the MD/AGENT to participate in the Money transfer along with thebranch BDM.He has been helping the Midnapur BDMs with the Mumbai-Bengal corridor ina big way and is monitoring the channel setup at the receiver Tehsilsvery aggressively. He has been to mumbai for few days to help theMumbai team to connect with the Bengal migrant pop @ Golibar.He has initiated the Coochbihar-Nadia intra state corridor although ininitial stage is progressing well.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:The Big shift target - cud achieve 80% of the Big Shift Target. The DBtargets for UAA and UTA was a miss although the effort was to get pastwhich shows that the Circle is much above NATIONAL Average in both theparameters.The merchant set up and Bulk deals (B2B & C2B) although a good nos arein pipe line but yet to start operating . The quality customerregistration is also not at a desirable state. The quality in terms ofT2M retention is same as other channels and there has been no majordifference in the KYC status.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):For achievement of Big shift the contribution of Bulk deals and B2C andC2B would have been a big enabler where it completely fell short. Afew large accounts on cash management could have kept the Circle wellpoised to be in the race of Big Bet.Also the approach on developing pipeline and conversion of leads need totake a well coordinated process with opportunity mapping and timelineattached from each branch. Getting into the bulk deals and crackingaccounts and a subsequent contribution is a crucial ask from this rolewhere Saugata needs to work on.Also specific customer connect activites including awareness and usagefocused on Money transfer would have helped in getting a steady flow ofrepeat users from Alternate channel registrations.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Saugata need to provide the BDMs with a clear Customer registrationstrategy which will help the circle in getting actual money transferusers grow steadily. He needs to map the specific corridors and take uppilots in few villages in the potential outmigrant Tehsils and thenreplicate the learnings to spread to the rest of the hot spots. Heneeds to have a clear time bound branchwise road map to acquire B2C andC2B and bulk accounts to generate both UUs and substantial throughputwherever we can pitch our product against the current cost of moneytransfer is higher than our margins. As there are a hole area unbankedand distance and geography being a challenge we have lots ofopportunityies to encash upon.The clear focus this year will be to look forward to close suchopprotunities from Sikkim . Must work on Sikkim as a special projectthis financial year. Also he needs to work closely with the Govtvertical team from VBS to crack DBTs and other such cash transferavenues. This will help develop the Eco system in the Circle along witha healthy throughput and customer acquisition.There should be a disproportionate effort to get KYC customers from themoney transfer corridors and intense drive on awareness generationthrough regular customer connect activites at village level andpanchayat level where outmigrant families are present.Progress on Development Goals:Saugata is learning to collaborate with Circle cross functional teams inhelping the zonal teams to smoothly operate m-pesa business as BAU andbuilding governance and processes necessary to intensify efforts fromfiled teams.Progress on Career Aspirations:Saugata is high on sincereity towards his key deliverables and he iswell poised to create a M-pesa Eco Sstem for the Circle by developingthe online/offline Merchant s and enterprise accounts . He needs to putacross best practices which will bring him recognition as one of thetop MDLs across Cirlces."

"The year started off with a lot of basics being put in place in theprevious JFM quarter. The efforts that have been taken in building amore sustainable business scenario was something that has been payingoff in the current year so far.What worked for Subhasish:It is important to mention a significant change in the way Subhasish hasapproached the business in the first half of this year. He has broughin a lot of positivity into the entire approach, has been able toconsistantly drive new agenda with a lot of vigour and at the same timehe has been able to improve the working relationships with the zones.What is important is - these were exactly the weaknesses that wereobserved in him in the previous assessment last year and the effortstaken by him to get back is highly appreciated.On the business front - the improvement in the transaction valuesconsistantly has been a good story - and this has come with improvementin infrastructure and is clearly a scalable and sustainable effort. Theagents expansion has been more or less on track and is one of thestrengths, with a good % of them who are UAA and UTA. KYC% has beenconsistantly at a good level. The alternate channel expansion has beengood and will remain a key pillar for the second half of the year also.What could have been better :From a DB point of view - the transactions are well below DB and alsothe customer acquisition number. Both these along with improvement inthe UU% are focus areas for the circle which is the focus for 2nd half.Very clealry Subhasish has evolved in the last one year in the area ofDrive, Analytical ability, Performance Orientation. He should continuethe good work in these areas - work a little more in the area ofEngagement and look for the next level roles."

He has created astrong pipeline accounts for Mpesa bulk business. He is a strong peoplemanager and very effective in managing cross-functional working. Mpesais ahead of throughput budget, Agent appointment and acquisitionremains a area of improvement. Throughput increase in H2 has beenimpressive. We have missed Big Bet by a whisker.He has done well as Branch manager Bilaspur - was able to controlchannel attrition issues. He could have done better on acquisitionnumbers and distribution parameters. He had handled local issues quiteeffectively and was quite instrumental in network planning androll-outs in power sector. Bilaspur town performance remained achallenge.Agent appointment was a miss. H1 backlog also put pressure in 2nd halfof the year. KYC could have been driven more.Building Mpesa Channel infrastructure, Quality acquisition,Documentation, Building Mpesa P2P corridors, converting bulk deals arefew of the priorities should be his focus area.

Aditya also creatednumerous MIS dashboards which helped the field team in driving KPIs. Hehas also done good work on SIP earnings with RMs & BDMs. He has boughtdown non-earning RMs count from 41 to 8 over a period of 6 months.Aditya missed out on the RTT Customer where we were able to achieve 70%of our customer RTT target. Even with low customer RTT achievement, T1M& T2M was very low at 25% & 13% respectively. Acquisition quality hasbeen a stress point leading to negligible growth in UUs in the entireyear. Agent balance was also a big miss where we could not touch the500 level. CSE productivity was again a big miss which could not betracked on daily basis. Aditya lacked speed in execution of brandactivities. Most of the time he had to struggle with brand team to getthe work done.Aditya is disciplined in his day to day working.

She needs tobring lot of healthy competition among EDs & Agents. Also she needs toensure monthly & fortnightly review meets with agents.

"Bahar Ramdasi is one of the extremely good resource of supply chainteam. He contributed extra ordinarily on savings generated as well asKPI improvement. Bahar contribution in order to support SIM requirementfor Loop Opportunity was high commendable.Bahar's team has over achieved on savings target by contributing around89 Mn to overall saving of 133 Mn. Bahar was himself handling allcompliance report submission for SOX Audit. He also contributed reallywell in achieving vendor optimization target on 363, which looks almostimpossible at start of year. For Loop Opportunity the way he handledcomplete project by working closely with S&D was inpeccable.Bahar could have done well in some areas of reporting where he delayedon time lines. Long tail procurement and sourcing championship projectthough turned out to be fruitful but progress was very slow movingagainst what was desired from corporate SCM teams. Also no specificimprovement was seen in contracts pending with Legal team. Thesespecific project could have speed up.Bahar is highly ambitious and focused when it comes to savings trackingand generation of innovative ideas. He actually worked closely withinternal customer group on various problem and supported in providedrelevant solutions in quick and simple way.He could have done well in areas of sourcing championship by takingaccountability of complete project and inspiring his team mates to meettimelines. Some of the reporting issues just got delayed due to lack ofsynergy between NW and Non NW functions within commercial team. Hecould have done better by more cross functional discussion with legalon agreement as well.Bahar shall continue to be a strong performer of SCM Team. In immediatefuture I look him to handle Network category of buying with sameenthuasim and zeal. With this I as well want him to develop more on hisleadership skills and also be mentor to his team in order to groom themon all processes of commercials. I also want him to focus on EVOimplementation and be on point SPOC from SCM side to all functions forsmooth transition.I would like Bahar to focus more on developing the team and mentoringthem for being his 2nd in line. He should be more aggressive on timelines.Bahar should aspire of becoming a SCM Head of a small circle by groominghis skills in Network Domain as well.Wishing you all the best for next year."
"What?Under Sandeep's leadership, the government business has over achievedall their critical KRAs of the mobility business viz. overall revenues,voice and data revenues, gross adds and net adds growing 38% over theprevious year in the process. He ensured that the government andacquisition teams capitalised well on the opportunity thrown up by Loopshutdown. By winning the largest M2M deal in the country from an SImanaging a number of transport entities, he and his team have set up anadvantage for VBS to further strengthen our position as a solutionprovider.The main miss during the year has been the non-achievement of FLDtargets both in revenues as well as in order booking. Contributionmargin has been lower than targeted despite increase in RPM and ahealthy data mix of revenues.How?Sandeep has executed national projects such as Projects Vistaar andSampark diligently mapping 7 out of 10 key priority ministries. He haspersonally ensured a very high degree of alignment between accountmanagement, customer service and acquisition teams working on thegovernment business. During the year, his team alongwith the alliancesteam have built strong relationships with key SIs and the benefit ofthis is visible in RFPs such as Cidco where 3 out of 4 shortlisted SIsare using Vodafone as their connectivity provider.Given the challenges in providing fixed line services to remotelocations in Maharashtra, Sandeep could have driven a greater number ofFLD deals within Mumbai albeit of smaller values to make an effort toreach close to the targets in this line. His team has been sub optimalin the use of 1SF and there have been instances of wrong deal sizes orexpired opportunities. Although there is a good ground level mapping ofcustomers, Sandeep should ensure a greater senior level engagement atkey government entities from Vodafone's side. Sandeep and Team need toreduce dependency on few accounts and need to build relationship andfunnel in non-penetrated accounts, to create a broader base.Development & Career objectives:Sandeep is a valuable resource for building the government business. Hiskey area of development for larger roles in the future would be greaterinfluencing without authority skills and an ability to plan and executemid to long term strategic programs. He needs to facilitate a mindsetshift from SIM selling to solution selling approach.Through a number of circle driven initiatives, Sandeep was providedinputs to enable a better self-awareness. While the L&D team helped himdraw up her IDP, the same was discussed at length and specific actionplans were chalked up in a tri-partite consultation between him, L&Dand the line manager.MYPDSandeep has managed his mobile revenue KRAs very well in H1 being 115%of DB. He has being pro - active in rationalising prices of low RPMcustomer and increase data penetration of base and new acquisition.FLD order booking and net adds growth have been the 2 big misses of H1.While there was effort to win FLD business most of the opportunitieswere not feasible for Vodafone. On the other hand , mobility net addscan be improved substantially by more comprehensive coverage of variousgovt entities in the circle.Sandeep will focus on building engagement with multiple stake holder andbroad base our coverage to capitalise fully on the Digital Indiaopportunities."
"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Sharada joined the team in June. She has been a part of very criticalprojects like MNP in prepaid, MNP 98201 campaign launch in postpaid,launch of Red & driving acquisition from RED in postpaid, driving CYNin prepaid, m-pesa throughput and slum activity. In all it has been anaction packed 5 months. She has demonstrated very good eye for detail,sharp eye for numbers, grasped the business very well and challengedthe status quo. Both Postpaid and Prepaid gross adds have been in linewith DB and MNP has more than doubled. Sharada is highly resultoriented and organizes her work accordingly.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:MNP 9820198201 campaign has been a huge success and has become a casestudy. A lot of the success is because of the detailing that wentbehind it -setting up the process for performance tracking, trackingthe performance for calls-leads-abandons, scheduled activity forSMS/OBD and measuring the success and cost parameters.Prepaid MNP especially Loop performance of Oct was approx. 80K. One ofthe primary factors was the speed to market in the launch of thespecial tariffs.Postpaid Gross adds have reached a new high of 70K+ with growth comingfrom Retail and DSA channel.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performanceWhile CYN performance has improved, we have still note crossed the 10%mark.SR in Postpaid has increased marginally. T6M quality has worsened.Red has been a slow start with <60% target achievement and stillwobbling in March after stupendous performance in FebHits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Sharada led the 9820198201 campaign from the front. She is a confidentperson with grasp on her profile. She was instrumental in forming themeasurement and tracking system of calls-abandons-leads-callbacks-activations. She engaged with the SuperCC team to put thetracking mechanism in place for the first time. She also meticulouslyplanned the SMS/OBD schedule with various operators and tracked theimpact as well as the costs of it closely. Even though new to theprofile, she got the 9820198201 IVR implemented which was routeddirectly to SuperCC instead of landing at the CC by working closelywith IT, CS and the corporate team. This was implemented in very shorttime span of 2 days of raising the DM. In the entire campaign she hasdemonstrated ability to manage a project, work with various teams andraise the benchmark.Various initiatives of m-pesa were carried out. Be it simpledemonstration of railway booking feature through the promoters amongstthe employees or working out the detailed plan of action on leveragingnavratri in the slums. Sharada also put together a calendar ofpromotion for the various m-pesa features and a tracking mechanism tounderstand efficacy. Most ot these activities were proactively done incollaboration with other team members. Not only that she spend andguided mpesa team to train them on making reports. She has worked onreducing Address level rejects thus influenced net gross in postpaid bymaking process corrections.Sharada is also extremely responsible. Once a task or responsibility isgiven to her, she takes it up completely and keeps everyone updated onthe progress.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Developing team and nurturing talent next year will be the key ask fromher. Often she takes up the responsibility upon herself, she needs tomove for individual doer to team work. Some instances are MNP leadscapturing from SuperCC for prepaid, 98201 IVR creation, m-pesaactivities. Often her team members are not kept updated of the detailsof the work being done. Thus a more collaborative environment andguidance to be provided to the team.Specific Focus on Way Forward:1. Team management as illustrated above. With members in the teamchanging, it will become even more critical2. Start engaging more with the sales team and giving idea to help themdo their tasks. Also to be tuned to the market with visits being morefrequent and calendarized.3. More focus on revenue and engaging with teams within marketing. Forexample how do we improve 121 at the time of acquisition, get more dataat the time of acquisition.4. Interaction with peers, especially the sales team to be seen as avalue add instead of just being a gate keeper."
Joe is now settled with all hiring and complete team. Joe has led histeam to close the financial year with a combination of hits andmisses.Misses on WhatTeam is lagging in both FLD order booking and revenue. This show in OBis compounded by narrow base of accounts that the NAM's are working andmissing the long tail accounts . There has been bad handling of largeaccounts like - ICICI/TCS/L&T etc. Large Opportunities raised in SFDChave gone unattended and deleted with out justifications. While theteam has shown lack lustre attitude around funnel build /movement andhygiene as line manager you have missed on tasking them. There has beensoft handling from your side. This has compounded with giving weakmonthly/quarterly commits by the team .I see clear miss on driving account plan with the team on top accounts( 30/60/90 plans ) month on month and quarterly. This should become amust review habit with the team to get better visibility and funnelbuild. SFDC review has been a big miss.The team has missed on attending training and self development in-spiteof repeated reminders over mails and Monday reviews. You have missedon pushing the team for product training on global portfolio.You need to build strong review mechanism with the team on weekly numbercommit and achievement and task the team for their commit.You need to monitor execution of large deals for both mobility and fixedline along with the delivery team to ensure revenue achievement. Teamneeds to be trained on process and system which they lag and in turncreates muck in the system.The team has low confidence in large deal closure and depends heavilyon VBS heads to front end. You need to mentor them to lead and close ontheir own. Its time that TCS & L&T should turn around next year as inFY 14 15 these accounts have tanked. You need to lead the team inextensive coaching and mentoring. Please step back from handholdingthem in day to day activity. This leadership will not yield in resultrather the team will always expect you to close transaction. Pleaseensure the team becomes independent of the leader....hence mentor thembut let them fight their own battle.Lastly as team lead you need to believe that a team will out performonly if you will dream big and push them to believe the same dream.Specific Focus for FY15-16Product training for the teamDrive and monitor account plans for top 30 accounts.Build team spiritShould spend time on the team and monitor progress and approach.Drive the team for product & solution training .Overall your performance is satisfactory and pleasure to working withyou.

Wehave been able to manage our own roll out target despite budgetconstraints .managing of resources are also exemplary. You have beenable to extract maximum from available resources. Closure of 25 midmile bldg. is also executed well. It was involvement in micro levelthat has given results.Touch point roll out is a miss. We have not been very consistent interms of rolling out touch point. There are gaps in traffic shifting &even though 50 rings are added but the objective of adding minimum 7nodes in OFC rings also takes a beating. The yield on the fiber is akey to success & surely lot of work has to be done to achieve it.it could be achieved by setting up outcome related goals & consider planto execute approach.VBS deliveries also requires more governance so that we can come back toGold category.With the organization requirement of 3G & LTE it is imperative for us tobuild a robust, reliable fiber network . We can do this if weconcentrate our results on outcome basis rather than only chasingnumbers."

WPP of joint meetingwith Sales / Service has been lead managed well and 9 companies havebeen brought under this fold. More work on this has to now happen tobuild and sustain on this.Overall mobility collections and bad debts have been a challenge in thehalf year under review and are not yet progressing on targets, thechallenge is higher as not closer to LYST either. Edwin has to driveperformance improvement and innovative ways to catch up on this in thebalance part of the year. Similarly for FLD collections and bad debtsthe drive which is evident with Edwin and team has to sharpen andimprove with speed on all parameters of collections and bad debts inthe second half. This has to be done thru driving new projects foridentifying areas which will contribute for higher collections and baddebts reduction.APD Comments :Edwin has lead a transformational journey for second year in a row. Froman era of dunning customers in VBS large cocp to collect, churnmanagement has never been a tool to collect. Rather retention, issueresolution, providing tailor made resolutions has been the mantra ofsuccess driven by Edwin and his team. Has lead to establish thatMobility collections and bad debt management is a BAU . learningjourney on FLDand FLV has picked momentum and is in the rightdirection. National deals streamlinining has been a continuous journeyand momentum should improve.Hits : What : collections strike rate is well on track and on increasedbilling 100% is envisaged by march end. Bad debts for mobility aremarginally higher than last year, however, considering the efforts andall round focus brought to streamline sustaining lower bad debts thisis a hit in terms of directional approach which will bring sustainedlower bad debt.How : persistence drive across all VBS segments, continuous journey ofcleanup, bringing steam to NIL usage cases and reducing their impact onbad debt and Muda elimination on targeting collections from nonrecoverable Nil usage cases. Stability in vendor partner teams hashelped sustaining and improving processes and bringing results.Misses :What : FLD and FLV and CWS collections and bad debts remain a seriouschallenge and performance at FLD 77.79 % remain a challenge. FLV hasalso dropped to 99.59 % and needs to come up the curve. Resultant baddebts of FLD @ 10.48 % are unsustainable. For FLV bad debts at 1.69 %there is room for improvement.HowWhile serious efforts were placed what is missed out is process relatedissues and the same need correction with collaborative work with VBSteam and corporate team.Way forward :Bring directional focus to Project Aryabhatta - zero bad debts. Completefocus on FLD FLV and transformations collection strike rate of 100 %and bad debts improvement with opportunity of past recoveries aswell.Drive process changes which and work on agreed WPP of joint visits withVBS team to ensure new customers have a seamless experience.

"MYPDHits - Good progress in Ip transformation & BW augmentation plan.

Due to lack ofinformation flow the confidence in our capability is questioned byhigher ups. it can be visible improved by providing weekly progressreport , daily trackers & improve overall communication within otherteams as well as to higher ups.Issues escalations must be done in a periodic fashion & it is projectmanager's responsibility to extract work from other teams to meet enddeliverables. Man management & interpersonal skills are key to successin any project.I'm sure that by prioritizing work within team & assign individualresponsibility in more objective way & with increasing the engagementwith other team we will be able to meet all expectations that are setto us.APDWe have progressed in IP transformation & addition of routers in thenetwork. We have also progressed with decent speed in 40 mbps CIRproject. The efforts taken in ASR 9k swap project is also appreciable.We have also managed & support roll out by issuing plans in timelymanner.The aspects where we have lacked is the same as I ve mentioned in MYPD.We have not been able to complete any project in totality (100%) be itCAT A, B,C,D or Router addition or 25 node b /port or SIU or 40 mbpsCIR. There may be various reasons of not achieving it & while we discusit during our review the bottom line is onus of completion of projectrests with project manager. I've also not seen much of improvement inproviding visibility of Projects, future plans , progress to otherfunctions & peers.This year the spot light is on transmission & organization is having agreat expectation from transmission team. The approach & work in yourvertical has to change completely . We will sit across & set someprocesses , critierias to excel on our journey. Remember either wesucceed together or fail together . There is no third alternative foryou & me. The first thing we have to do is to agree on that projecttimeline is from now onwards a project deadline. Looking forward for agreat year ahead & transmission 2.0 will be a reality only if we exceedin everything we set for our self."

"You are a diligent & dependable worker. You approach given tasks withrequisite urgency and are able to complete them within the given timeframe, without much of followup. Not only do you finish things on time,the quality of output thatyou produce is also quite good. Rarely doesone find gaps in the output. You are also able to multi task and hencemore and more responsibilities come your way. This also helps you tolearn new things and grow professionally.Launch of VFSA is a great achievement and you have been able to handleit well by doing the initial rounds of training to the front line. Youneed to nurture this further, to complete the next round and alsoincorporate the ISP's / DSA team in it going forward.

He has also been instrumental in conducting variousevents like zonathons / ACE etc.Some of the strengths that you display / bring to table are speed,consistency, persistence, innovative thinking (VPL contest), quality ofwork, long term vision, good in cross functional working etc and youmust leverage these going forward.Rohan needs to ensure that he conducts the VFSA exceedingly well.Launching it is 1 bit, but taking this agenda forward, consistently andprogressively to make a big difference to the over all skill level ofpeople resulting in business gains is a totally different ball game. Inaddition, more degree of science needs to be put in terms of loopingthe feedback back to zones on the RED audits.

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Nishant had expressed desire to move into bigger broader role and he hasbeen assigned the responsibility of head U&R recently. Nishant has beenassociated with the Go to Market Strategy for mobile wifi & iPhonelaunch. He has also worked closely with the retail team for the iphone6launch and managed the SMS campaign and EDM in a very short span oftime. He has also ensured that all handset data bundle offer tie upsdone at corporate is rolled out at circle within specified timelines.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Mobile wifi is selling close to 500 units from stores. Nishant ensuredthat all stake holders like retail leads, geek squads, vbs team,supercc and mto are trained on the product and selling pitch. Theentire GTM docket was created. Product proposition for both prepaid andpostpaid was created and launched.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance1. MBB sales has dropped in the second half of the year. The target wasto take it up to a consistent 10K per month. After 499 was closed, nonew impetus was created to achieve the targets2. Device change program was shifted from the service team to theoutbound sales team. We used to be able to upsell 3-4K pack everymonth. The sales reduced to <1000 per month. The trend was noticedlate, after almost one month. The course correction to reach the oldlevels and take it upwards has still not happened.3. Prepaid device change program was started; however it has not shownany results. There are approx. 2lac HSPA handsets which get added everymonth at a gross level. Device change was instituted last year and wasa initiative of Mumbai. We have not succeeded into taking it to largerscale and maximise the opportunity into data revenue.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Nishant has engaged with various teams to get training done for mobilewi-fi. However hits on the 'how' aspect of the performance could havebeen much betterMisses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):1. Achieving targets and driving numbers with other teams. Device changeprogram which was once a best practise saw numbers crash from 3-4k tosub 500. Besides the fact that the trend was notice one month late, theexpectation is to take charge to course correct by engaging withvarious teams, escalation to the higher authorities if required,introduction of incentive or some inputs to change the trajectory. Thiswas completely missing2. Drive to take initiative. Gizmo help has been in the considerationfor some months now. Nishant did all the hard work to close themodalities of the way this will work. However the project took morethan 6 months for details to get closed. But the project has still notbeen taken forward and launched. Nishant has not shown the initiativeto present it to senior management by making t their top of mindamongst various other priorities and remained completely passive. Hehas not demonstrated any passion or taken the initiative to get thisproject launched.3. Passion to lead a project. Mobile wi-fi is one of the most criticallaunches and a differentiator in the market. Nishant should be leadingthis from the front. This is also the single project being handled byNishant. But many areas of improvement - stocks in MTO did not reach toleverage Diwali, prepaid product launch took almost a month, eye fordetails in leading a project was missing like what should be the GTM,who should we train and when, what should be the training module, howshould the fulfilment happen, what are the various on and off groundinitiatives that we should take etc. All these were done eventually butafter being asked. The energy, idea generation and passion to seesuccess was missing. Nishant should be able to lead a project end toend and plan accordingly.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Nishant has been given the role of U&R head to spearhead the voicejourney in the circle. This role requires a lot of on the feetthinking, drive, ideas and mentoring the team. He also needs to buildtrust to lead a project with many stakeholders and be a lot moreproactive."

You have also been able to handle the teamtransition well, when almost your entire team got changedThe effort put down in terms of TAT improvement is noteworthy. This isnot only creative, but is also a step in the direction of being morecustomer centric. The MTO team has been very well poined on the entireiPhone gameplan and has garnered highest sales nationally. Over alleffort in setting up the business and ensuring delivery was good.Postpaid as been a weak link and going forward, you must ensure that youturn it around, the way you have done on data / prepaid. You areoperationally strong, but must start planning ahead of curve. You mustlook at improving situational leadership and strategic thought process.Ex: The thought of creating intermediate hubs forentering CAF shouldhave come from you. Or putting the floater model for iphone fulfilmentwhich is customer centric are expected for the MTO head.Stake holder management is another area which you must focus on. As avertical head, you are also expected to have better control on yourprojections, which have been found to be all around in the past. Speedin executing things is another area that you must look at improving.Ex: Launch of WiFi zone at MT outlets."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Manju is good with her relationship management skills with her clients.She maps the account and engages with all the stakeholders. She isresponsible for very large and significant accounts and has ensuredthere is strong engagement.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Achieved national revenue target of 96% YTD. FLD OB target vsachievement is at 94%. Substantial amount of new business generated.From Nielsen 1000 data sims activated, IMRB 270 dongles churned fromcompetition, opened FLD in Godrej with 28lac order, 36lac fromBloomberg, 21lac from Vedanta which is a new logo. Good number of CXOmeetings were conducted throughout the yearMisses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Manju comes with enriched telecom experience hence there was higherexpectation from the seasoned NAM. Revenue target vs achievement at96%. Godrej resign delay. ABG low FLD order closure vs target. Novartistablet MBB opportunity is not closed. Vedanta mobility + FLD notexecuted. Bloomberg IPLC loss. Bayer contract resign was prolonged &TFS order loss.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):In the Nielsen opportunity, Manju engaged all the stakeholders inVodafone and at the customer end very well. The CEC visit and SLTengagement helped to establish confidence. She also positioned theMpesa team at the right time to the relevant members in Nielsen. Herengagement with the KDM in Bloomberg and assurance with SLT meetingshas helped in gaining more trust and business from them, collaboratedwell with the GAM. In the case of Vedanta there was good mapping withmultiple teams in the NHQ locationMisses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Godrej which is such a critical resign could have been effectivelymanaged and completed even before the 3rd quarter could have led toincremental connections and revenue. Even effective NHQ mobilityacquisition mapping had very low visibility, could have increased ourrunrate. We expected ABG group companies to be mapped well and exploreavenues of mobility business. Increase and ramp up share of fixed lineto be atleast in the top 3 service providers. Early engagement inNielsen would have certainly helped in identifying the potential ofNielsen and closed the opportunity in Q2 & maximize over-all revenuewhich is now at 96%. Expected an effective cross functional project tobe driven which has not materialized.Other areas of improvement:Opportunity management of SFDC could be done frequently. This is minimumexpectation from seasoned NAM. Account plan creation and update shouldbe done at least for top accounts like Godrej, Bloomberg, ABG, Vedanta.Meeting with business heads more proactively and have a consultativeapproach.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Strategic account management. Know and read more about your customerClose landmark deals. Deliver big bets.Focus on building unique business solutions.Focus on driving cross functional projectsProgress on Development Goals:The certification on Vodafone Way of Living and presentation skills weresuccessfully done.

"You have definitely worked hard and achieve full score in all of yourKPI. Core network complaints were reduced to a major extent which wasonly possible through your focused approach. We scored Gold in corenetworkHits1. Core network in gold, because we scored full marks in all KPI.2. Core nodes upgrade successfully.3. Switch complaints reduced to a very large extent4. Good work in HSW frontHow aspect of hits:1. The network came in Gold because we scored full marks in all KPI.Your dedicated focus on the KPI achieved the result.2. 12B upgrade was done successfully. Timely coordination and propertracing of the upgrade project resulted in the successful grade withoutany discrepancy.3. Proper tagging of customer complaints reduced the count in ourbucket. Your proactive approach to visit Mohali and giving training toCS team proved to be beneficial.4. You are leading your element in a proven manner with right approach.You are very active in HSW.Misses1. HLR outage due to lack of sensitivity of ownership.2. Team ownership and non -review of the data send to me.3. No data availability to perform impact analysis during node isolationor fiber cut.4. Lack of ownership for testing equipment (protocol analyzer) duringAT.How aspect of misses1. HLR outage was a big blunder. Team is not following process and theyare skipping it just to save time. This is a lame excuse and you shouldbe stringent in process application.2. I am receiving CR and PPT data without being reviewed thoroughly. Itis like passing the stuff directly without adding any value. You haveto own the team. If I am asking some explanation from you, then you areanswerable, you cannot pass buck down the line. You have to manage thisthing internally without exposing the whole team to me. If engineersare answerable then why I need manager in between them. I can directlyask them. Pl follow correct hierarchy.3. You don't have the data for all of our nodes. It was told earlieralso that everybody in team should paste the data at their desk, sothat in case of any outage, people can provide the data without furtherwasting time in searching for it.4. We bought very expensive protocol analyzer, but nobody is showinginterest as how can we optimize it for own purpose. We should beproactive enough to prepare AT document and get everything tested fromthe vendor. Except Ankit nobody has clue if it is working for PRI ornot.Special focus of H2:We are moving towards data evolution. We have to focus more on our IPcapabilitie. Also every team members should be hands on coreoperations. Senior team members should also take interest in coreplanning & budgeting.Area of development:Please increase your technical exposure on IP system. Getting Cisco IPcertification will be very useful.Career Aspiration:You didn't put any aspiration, but I feel that you should alsoparticipate in core budgeting. This can elevate you at higher level.Versha you are working average, and you need to work more proactive inyour domain. You have to work smart, expectations are higher."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:In-depth technical acumen on GSM coupled with high dedication and can doattitude has paved way for improving NQI and TCH drop in the mostcritical zone, better NQI and TCH drop than last year is evident tothis fact. Efficient handling of spectrum re-farming is noteworthy tothis fact.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:By physical site audit accompanied with parameter tuning done forproviding better indoor coverage in congested areas and hence reducingthe requirement of booster installation. Half rate and cell loadingsharing parameter tuning have been carried out to address Cells havingconsistent TCH blocking cells. Focus was laid on road optimization forcoverage and quality based on RNO measurement reports. Emphasis wasgiven to physical sites audit, antenna alignment for different bands,tilt / orientation correction, neighbour deletion/addition, frequencycorrection, parameter optimization, etc., etc. In addition, weeklyhigh TN drop cells were identified and special task force was formed torectify issues pertaining to these cells. Focus was laid on layer-wisecall drop issues; due to antenna mis-match, MAIO, traffic movementbetween layers and action has been taken thereof. Cell level parametertuning including offset/CRO/layer and threshold tuning done for IBScells for proper coverage/quality. By regular RF parameters tuning,physical audits, frequency plan download, closely monitoring the KPIsof each & every site in the zone, he could maintain best Downlinkquality in central zone - best among Ericsson Circles beating Punjab,Kolkata & Mumbai. Due importance was given to new sites optimizationby carrying out drive test, log file analysis, physical audits,parameter tuning of new as well as existing sites in the cluster.Special focus was drawn to improve NQI with reference to TCH blockingand suggested plan for the same with TRX re-shuffling, hardwareaddition, traffic sharing for approx. 200+ cells, ensured sectoraddition to TCH blocking - this has given good results. Re-definingof LAC has helped to improve TCH and SD blocking. Handover successrate KPI was improved by frequent consistency check to resolve BA listissue, neighbor trimming, handover parameter tuning, viz., BQOFFSETAFR,BQOFFSET, HIHYST & LOHYST, removing overshooting on more than 350cells by physical audits, frequency correction, handover reversions dueto wrong BSCH/BSIC, neighbor parameter tuning, etc. which enabled tomaintain handover success rate above 98% always. Emphasis was laid onimproving voice quality by working on co-located MTS sites and byantenna separation between MTS & Vodafone antenna, carried out physicalaudits of more than 1700 cells mainly based on fault management report- this has given cluster-wise voice quality improvement. Quarterly newfrequency download has been carried out thereby reducing downlinkinterference, better voice quality and improvement in customerperception. Identified faulty & illegal boosters by using spectrumanalyzer & removed it with the help of WPC from Rajendar Nagar area.The above steps helped to achieve NQI of 9 vis-a-vis 5 of last year(before spectrum re-farming)Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Reduction of customer complaints has been a concern due to high externalinterference in highly congested clusters. Moving of high value subbase to new locations of NCR with consequence of arising coverage /quality concerns. UL quality is another fact which is yet to theaddressed.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):RF parameter tuning done for BQOFFSETAFR, BQOFFSET, HIHYST & LOHYSTresulted in a massive improvement in HOSR NBH & BBH. Identified 90sites bearing high external interference due to MTS & CDMA sharedsites. Physical audit done for all 170 sites & take up the matter withMTS for antenna separation results in massive improvement in KPIs inConcerned areas complaints. OL/Ul parameter LOL, SCLD & CHAP changedfor Low TASR 90 MBC cells resulted in tremendous improvement in TASR atNBH/BBH. Frequent consistency check, neighbor and parameter tuning,frequency correction, HOSR reversions due to BSCH & BSIC issues hashelped to further improve the KPI. Quality issues occurred due to MTSsites have been attended thereby improving the customer perception.Worked on approx 825+ poor performing cells having severe issues suchas high DCR, TCH blocking, SD blocking, high handover failure rat -identified the cause & taken necessary action to correct them. Carryingout drive test, log file analysis, physical audits, parameter tuning ofnew as well as existing sites has given an edge over competition in allmajor KPIs like TCH Drop, HOSR, SD Drop, SD & TCH blocking. Focus waslaid on adding more sectors wherever single sector ODM exited, therebyimproving customer perception in the cluster, in addition to improvingTCH Blocking & TCH Drop. TCH blocking issues have been attended by TRXre-shuffling, hardware addition, traffic sharing for approx. 80+ cells.LAC changes have been carried out based on TCH traffic movement whichcould improve TCH & SDCCH blocking in addition to improving SD droptoo.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):High external interference caused due to faulty repeaters resulted intoincrease in customer complaints. With the introduction of high risecluster in NCR and people moving over to the high rise buildings, hasfurther aggravated the situation of rising complaints. High externalinterference due to MTS sites and cheap boosters have deteriorated theUL quality of the Network.Priority was given to HSW rules and norms. There was no instance of anymisses on HSW on his day to day tasks. ATHR re-capitulation trainingis required.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Looking forward to achieve Gold Network nationally and to be bestEricsson Network.

Network availabilityof IP/MPLS network maintained at 99.999% and Network Service LevelParameters maintained at 99.98%.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:VBS technology and Wipro teams needs to be driven aggressively withtimely deliveries and escalations to relevant stakeholders. Backlog ofdeliveries created in system due to Wipro manpower issue, which wasescalated to top management as well. Few critical links delivery weredelayed in delivering due to equipment or ROW permissions. Moreaggressiveness needed in getting tasks done on time from differentstakeholders. Timely sensing issue and getting it addressed is verycritical so that deliveries and ops does not suffer.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):He lead Wipro manpower issue in good manner with management &collaborated with CO VBS technology team effectively to ensure smoothoperations and best possible deliveries.

Have good relation with VBS counter parts at circle & COlevel.He is a good listener and takes suggestions in a positive manner.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Now that VBS sales and delivery team have become very aggressive due toDB pressure and revenue, he needs to be on top of everything related toVBS deliveries and shake every relevant stakeholders in system toensure timely deliveries. Some of the delivery tracking & monitoringneeds to be streamlined and addressed. Need more focus & passion tomeet VBS fiber rollout and sites relocations. Proper managing SDM hasbeen challenge. End to end delivery of a partcular link to be monitoredin current complex scenerios and timely communication to stakeholdersmust happen, rather than surprised to SDM, stakeholders.Specific Focus on Way Forward:VBS deliveries on time. Tracking to be done from WO till closure onsystem, existing process & governance gaps to be filled. Serviceassurance as per TAT to be done and relevant gap in Wipro way of workto be clearly discussed and new options to be given to CO team forimprovement in assurance and deliveries. Also there has been focus onreducing Opex by managing bandwidth on our network instead of leasedmedia. This needs to be driven more and leased media needs to bereduced. Future planning for VBS deliveries to be incorporated incircle scheme of planning and execution. Also innovative methods toreduce CAPEX needs to be driven for VBS deliveries and fibre. HSWshould be focal point with team and all partners/vendors. Team has tobe trained and technically upgraded for better efficiency and on IPtechnologies.Progress on Development Goals:He is now dedicatedly looking after VBS technology.

"Modern trade has delivered moderately in first half. The biz is ontarget on few parameters but in few missed by mile. The larger marketopportunity has not been captured despite repeated assurancesespecially in Data, Tablets, new alliances and Post-paid business. Byvirtue of traditionally strong wrt revenue, MT biz of Delhi continuesto be the largest biz in the country but other circles are growingfaster and our Growth rate has been low.Hits - Highest revenue Nationally, Highest MI pack in MT, PostpaidQuality Improvement are the hits in first halfHow Hits - She has driven team to deliver on these few top KPIs anddriven by large promoter numbers backed up by adequate incentives, R&Rsand SAC support. She pushes team hard to get business.Misses - Postpaid business after touching peak of 3.5K dropped this yearso far. The Quality has gone for a complete toss and could not sustainthe numbers ramp up. The overall business has not been built. Thepromoters productivity and non-promoter stores productivity has notimproved. This is major miss and grossly far away from Postpaid RevenueAOP targets. Prepaid too much dependence is only on one channel ""Gomobile"" and rest of the accounts have not been developed. PrepaidQuality has been a miss and no significant improvement or efforts havebeen put in. The SAC Management is another miss and with constantfeedback to her, hasn't improved.Activation TAT for Prepaid and Postpaid has been area of great concernwhile the entire circle has improved substantially and showing signs ofimprovement on day on day, Modern trade TAT struggle continue and theyare delivering unbarring / TV Ready in <24 Hours to just 48% ofcustomers Vs circle at 78% of customers.Her People management has been an issue and time over and again it hasnot improved. Team has been raising issue about her harsh behavior,biased / preferential approach. Recently got one more escalation fromone of her team member. She has been a miss in managing and directingteam on way forward.How Miss -Her time management needs drastic improvement as she is always last insubmitting all requirements at circle level. This hasn't seen anyimprovement in H1. This is being told every time in the feedbackdiscussion. Her approach delays total Circle reporting and criticalpresentations. Her SAC understanding is poor and she doesn't worktowards getting understanding clear. Promoter management despiteumpteen number of reminders / feedback -Positive / negative both hasalso been a big area of improvement along with team management. Theamount of money we spent on monthly basis on promoter has not beenleveraged. Quarterly R&R has also been very irregular in MT and notplanned. Incentive disbursal has been erratic because of wrong SACprovisioning etc. Over all team management is an issue and she is veryfixed / firm on her approach and doesn't give team much space tooperate and work with freedom. She is very authoritative in herdealings with her team.Her agency management is poor and below average. Her market visits,channel delight and problem solving approach are very weak. Most of thechannels do complain about issues to Corporate team and postinterventions get resolved..Interventions and Development Required -Her follow up and closing of all issues are an area of improvement. Mostof the escalations come from corporate team for Delay in modern tradepayments to channel partners in Delhi. She doesn't deep dive intobusiness and processes and hence struggle on occasional fronts. Sheneeds to work upon her managerial abilities and financial understandingwrt SAC management immediately else she will not be doing her jobproperly. She also go on sudden leaves on last min information, whichis not very good reflection of great leadership qualities and in firsthalf has happened multiple times. Normally Monday and Fridays aread-hoc leaves.She must attend ""Finance for Non Finance"" Workshop, ""Managing Change""kind of workshop and should be part of Cross functional projectinvolving applied thinking and Change"" at the circle level. Sheoperates from very fixed mindset and is not ready for change. She needsto really understand the changing dynamics of modern business and hencechanging requirements and her deliverables.Career AspirationsShe doesn't have any career aspirations and even if she has then she isnot working towards it. She is in this role for 6 plus years and nownot contributing to growth. She must now take on a different role asshe has been doing similar role for over years which are impacting herself-learning and development. This is not letting any fresh thoughtsin the system. She MUST move on to a new role now without any moredelay. She hasn't applied in any IJP and has not tried for any post inlast 6 months.Over all H1 has been a kind of YO-YO and overall performance requiresignificant improvement."

He should havetaken new initiative rather than continuing with same old construct.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):For Current Role :- Sumit has used his familiarity with Delhi market very well to identifypockets of opportunity and started actions on those.- His communication and climate setting within the team has helped himget off to a good start.- HSW -- Sumit is on top of HSW and also sub element leader in S&M vertical andis doing his role religiously on weekly / daily basis.

He has started interacting with cross functional team moreoften. As he is not a self-starter always, the role of a leaderhandling a business vertical could be a challenge. He has startedshowing some signs of improvement in this area post MYPD feedback,which is good sign. He Has been selected as Zonal Head for East NCR andthe start has been great for him. He is inquisitive and willing tolearn fast. Sumit is getting more into financial understanding anddistribution understanding which is good and will certainly help him inlong term and short term career aspirations. He should highlight hisachievements at all levels more often, may be marketing of the work heis doing is missing.He needs to now improve his financial understanding and exposure inChannel management. He needs to be taken through ""Finance forNon-finance"" and ""Effective Presentation and influential communicationskills"" workshops.He is a good resource and is very productive this year. He hassignificantly improved his market connect, drive and relationship to alarge degree.

"Priya in Retail Service has had a mixed first 6 months of the currentyear. What went well for Priya was getting the JSY program forward forRetail Delhi. This empowered the frontline execs in resolving thecustomer quieries quicker and adding to the overall customerexperience. Priya has also worked well in getting the manpowersituation under control and her active partnership has now resulted ingetting the manpower deficit position , especially at te exec levelunder control. Priya has also worked well in getting the TNPS processstreamlined in terms of getting the inputs from the system and rollingthe same out to the frontline execs.The above was achieved by her dedication and her diligent approach.However some key challenges were faced in the first half year which haveto be worked upon and corrected in the second half. The key deliverablewould be to work on the TNPS program , partner with various stakeholders like CS and marketing and correct the processes depending uponthe VOC to ensure that the TNPS scores are favourable.The other area which needs to be worked upon is to get he servicesindices like AWT / MAX Wait time/FTR/ and Q&Q scores under controlwhich are the key customer service matrix.The focus on the above service indices would be v imp in the comingmonths."

He has taken newinitiatives on his own which are helping entire team to perform better.He is far more responsive in his approach and is delivering KPI andResults month on month. He has started interacting with lot of salespeople and has been chasing lot of KPIs out of his job role whichclearly reflects his approach to learn and develop much faster now. Hehas created stature for his role by his value additions and teamengagement.HITS - Sales Incentive Plan (SIP) has been a great story and full creditto Ajay for ensuring end to end communication and understanding wrtdistribution team.

But after that he hasturned them around now in 2nd half.How Miss - Slow start in taking on new challenges and responsibility.His Timelines sometimes still remain an area of improvement. He is nota self-starter and need to be pushed to do a job. He needs to improveupon other KPIs as well like Trainings efficacy.On an overall annual basis - a good performance by Ajay Kaul and hasadded lot of value in field sales system.As he is aspiring for the Zonal Head / Vertical head for some circle heneed to work upon his approach wrt taking new challenges andinitiatives. As he is not a self-starter, the role of a leader handlinga business vertical can become a big challenge, which he needs toovercome. He needs to improve his financial understanding.

"Anubhuti outs her heart into everything she has been giving her best toadapt to this industry, which is her first time in Telecom. Alsoappreciable is her attitude of looking at things differently, andquestioning processes & things which she doesn't agree with.On number & revenue churn, Jaipur zone under Anubhuti's leadership, hasbeen consistent in delivery. In-fact, Jaipur's performance has been agood support to the circle performance on churn, in a year that wasdifficult. The only thing that left something to be desired for was thehealth of retention, which clearly should have been worked upon. Healthof retention impacts the workable data for the teams on a monthlyrotational basis.On Retail quality, wile th targets have been met, however, a clear misswas the coverage of retail points by Anubhuti. As ZCSI, it is clearlyexpected to maintain regular contacts with the team on ground in termsof visits. While Anubhuti did try to manage things over phone, and thrupersuasion with the retail lead, her on ground visibility could haveshaped things much better.Fair work done on Activations & m pesa piece, given the manpowerchallenges faced by the zone.Her regular interaction with the AO forced, helped create awarenessamong the team on sensitivity of their roles for the organization.She needs work with more cross functional teams and define ownershipsduring interaction also, improve her understanding on retail service.She should aspire to work towards establising her as a strong ZCSI."

"Hits : H1 was a great time for Amrit with DATA being the main growthdriver for the circle and being one of the major reasons why we gainedRMS overall and widened gap with Airtel though H2 wasn't as good as H1.The major hit has come in from 3G and the YOY/ARPU growth andrevenue/site are clear indicators of the same. Postpaid has been astrong pillar for Data and is surely a hit for the circle and forAmrit. In VAS/SMS the degrowth has been stemmed and resulted in beingahead of DB too. Content degrowth has now stopped and CT, the mainstayof VAS is also on gradual improvement now.Prepaid DATA @ 92% achievementPostpaid DATA @ 95% achievementVAS/SMS @ 103% achievementOverall @ 95% achievementHow : This has been made possible by Amrit by tremendous passion to workand not buckle under pressure. He has also mobilized his team very welland made each of his 3 members self-sufficient in driving operations.Improving the campaign effectiveness of DATA via outbound andincreasing DATA via 121 and DSKH have been strong input factors to makethis possible. Data Star launchMisses : In a year where we were comfortably cruising @105% of DBachievement in DATA we have seen a slump in growth rates for at least4-5 months consecutively and thus resulted in shortfall vs DB by a bigmargin ( 93.5% achievement). In such a scenario no major innovation wasseen which could arrest the slump and turn it around. Feb/March hasbeen better with new sites getting launched however action around newsite roll out was absent and unlike the last set of roll out theintensity was missing.Also something that has been a miss since beginning of the year has beenthe UU growth . Sustained effort on UU could have resulted in arrestingthe drop in H2 and could plan for the higher trajectory in H2 DB.Rev/Site has also been a miss and has been mostly a derivative ratherthan an input to actions for growth. Segmented and specific activitiesaround such indicators are needed to have sustained and uniform growthfrom all customer segments/geographies.One more miss has been the lack of action on the SMS portfolio whichcould have seen better growths with a basic approach used in DATA onsegmented offers and beyond.How : The wayforward and the one of the reasons has been because amongthe various initiatives that have been launched/activities done therehasn't been proper closure and final impact measured. Also innovationin UU/new sites hasn't really been tried out and thus has been heavilycentered around campaigns/upsell which now needs to be the focus area."
"Hits : In a challenging year Archit has managed to protect base bykeeping base decay under check with RES to RES @ 94% organically. Alsowinbacks from ZU base has improved month on month as per plan and hasprotected us from RES loss aside the TERM impact. Also over the courseof H1 Prepaid MNP has become net positive due to reduction in POsignificantly from 8k levels to 6k levels now. While voice revenue hasnot grown HVC/UHVC base contribution and revenue contribution has beenmaintained which has helped in protecting 60% of revenues.RPM management as per DB and beyond has been achieved and has helpedmitigate the MOU and RES loss to some extent.Prepaid RPM is 0.5p ahead of DB. (64.5p vs. 64p)Postpaid RPM is 2p ahead of DB RPM (59.4 vs. 57.5p)On postpaid side revenue churn in consumer has been maintained withinmanageable levels though churn has gone up overall. This also isindication of revenue being protected from decay/MNP. Launch of RED andits uptake from base has been encouraging and for sure is helping us inARPU improvement.Prepaid ARPU has been maintained @ Rs 158 vs Rs 160 LY while PostpaidARPU is @ Rs 615 vs Rs 613 LY.How : Archit has managed this with a cool head despite tremendouspressure from industry and TERM cell. He has successful made Goldmine astrong property and utilized 121 to the fullest in the retailer leg. Hehas also stepped up to support his relatively young team and many atimes rectified/corrected issues and problems so that business is notimpacted. His demeanor with other departments is exemplary which hasresulted in better synergies and thus business betterment Initiativeslike Raksha has been managed well and underscore the attention todetail which Archit always displays.Misses : MOU/sub and UU in prepaid and MOU/sub and Churn in postpaidare misses which has been behind DB from April onwards. In a scenariowhere industry has been worse off than previous year we have beenimpacted severely and has thus led to voice being behind DB and flat vsLY.How : In a scenario where we were under challenge Archit should haveinnovated much more in either product/ 121/ segmentation/geography etcto correct the scenario. Similarly while we saw churn being impactedin Postpaid, Archit could have delved to understand the reasons betterand thus take corrective actions."
"AbhijnanAbhijnan has been an important contributor to the overall sales teamperformance. His focus on execution, the keenness to take on newchallenges and an overall positive and can do attitude are hisstrengths. Coupled with the basic nature of going into the depth ofthings and not being superficial help him in his overall performanceWhat went well :He has taken on several initiatives during the first half. The keystrength is his ability to listen to the requirement and quicklyconvert it to a actionable plan and most importantly followupcompletely as far as delivery is concerned. While ideas like Prathamaand Situational training were discuss in terms of the basic intent, hehas been able to make these programs with a lot of thought. Also theway Prathama has been launched, executed and sustained - a lot of thecredit for this goes to him. He also worked on the VFSA pilot launch inKolkata and has been an important resource even for the corporatedistribution team. Also he has gone beyond his call of duty on severaloccasions. When the challenge of bring back the excitement in thetelecalling challenge was thrown to him, he has quickly accepted it andensured that this was quickly initiated. The same was also done whenthe scope of Prathamawas to be extended to channels beyond prepaid. Hehas also worked very diligently on the HSW area - in the role of thefunctional SPOC for S&M. He has driven the KRCC agenda, the Passportcompletion and the regular tasks pertaining to ensure that HSW isadhered to within the S&M fraternity.What could have been better :Overall - most of the tasks have been in order. Also the approach hasbeen fantastic. Coming 6 months, Abhijnan can work on taking the VFSAmodule execution to the next level. The situational training issomething that can be taken as a key focus area.He is ready for the next level role and surely should be immediatelyconsidered for a ZM level role. He has the hunger to learn and thecapability to work in large teams. He is a valuable resource to theorganization."
"Naveen was moved into the role of one of the AMs for Telemarketing - tohandle one of the largest channel partners. The telemarketing businesswas going through a huge upheavel during this time and needed a verysteady hand to bring certain degree of stability to the operations.What went well -The postpaid business in TM was dipping very badly and was alsosuffering from huge quality issues - with SMD crosing the 40-45%levels. Naveen was able to engage regularly with the channel partnerand start settling things over a period of time. The trend is on theupswing and this has come by taking some harsh measures. A lot ofagents where there were quality issues have been let go off, whichresulted in a drop in numbers, but is also helping in establishing amore robust channel for the future. Also SAC corrections to rein in SMDhas been implemented - despite resistance from the channel. Naveen isfocussed on basics and does not get into short term measures, hence isa right resource to set this channel in order. The channel has beensuffering from good leadership, and when the vacancy of the TM/Super CCLead arore, Naveen has been moved into this role.What could have been better - Given the challenges the need of the hourwas to set basics in place. The spped of changes could have been a lilfaster. The channel partner alignment needs to be worked on to ensurehigher focus on a quicker business recovery. In the new role, Naveenalso needs to get other channel partners into the foray and it iscritical that the new channel partner who has been recently appointedneed to be inducted well. The challenges of the channel are big andneeds Naveen to get the unit into a performance oriented mode withclear milestones to be crossed in limited timelines.Matured professional, understands business well.Have leadership material, need to put in OJT for bigger roles in future.APD feedback-naveen has recently been moved to head telemarketing.what went well-telemarketing channel has gone thru lot of upheavel in last year butpost naveen taking over as TM head things are getting back in shape.thepeople challenges in SCC are tackled very well and he is able to bringin fresh perspective and renewed energy in that vertical.naveenconstantly thinks and is passionate about his work.his determination tosucced and hunger for business is evident from lot of initiatives takenby vertical in last 3 months.the cross functional coordination hasimproved drastically and now he partners with marketing team fortraining and products.his engagement with marketing has helped them inunderstanding the issues of TM better and now the coordination isbearing fruits in times to come.naveen has a very positive approachtowards people and genuinely believes in people development.he isextremly good in garnering competition info and analysing it to takedecisions.he is very well aware about the ecosystem in which businessoperates.good work done in improving contribtuion of combo plans,REDsale and project akramanwhat could have been better -we should have been able to build SCC to deliver monthly DB as it is ainhouse operaiton and were within striking distance.channel partnerattrition could have been prevented (resolution).we have not been ableto add infrastructure to existing system whether in terms of newpartners or expansion of current partner however lot of work hashappened in march in terms of identifying partners and launching thenew payout structure which will help in building a fastastic businessin next year."
"Adarsh :As a BDM Adarsh is very strong in his overall understanding of thecircle revenue drivers and an important anchor for the marketing team.He is very sharp analytically and able to deconstruct a revenuechallenge into the individual components. He is comfortable withcomplexity and has demonstrated abilities in finding root cause toproblems.While he is very strong in his overall understanding of most businessprocesses, for an important role like a BDM he has to show the energyand pro-activeness not just to report but also to shape and influencethe KPI and drive it relentlessly. What we found lacking was thedesperation to drive large themes like Data and VOICE MOUs. He isexcellent in the conventional format and needs to look at ways toimpact business KPIs in large and bold ways. He has to spend more timewith his team to discuss on inputs which will influence business KPIs.In the last few months, his interaction with the sales team hasimproved significantly and there is better understanding of the market.Hits :1. Good RPM management in pre and post where in spite of acquisitiontariff impact the RPM has been ahead of DB2. RMS gain in spite of subscriber churn because of heightened Term cellactivism: 1.6 lakh RES churn in FY 153. Drive Value at acquisition : Prepaid has been focused on High FR/CYNand Data attachment , all of which has led to unique attachment @ 51%now from a sub 15% at start of the year4. Good focus on DATA attachment and MBB drive in postpaid5. Able to conceptualize and drive the Raksha program. The program hasbeen able to save 5k subs from the VTM base.6. Drive SKH as a propertyMisses1. Decay of 2G data as a category2. Not able to take up new initiatives and get critical number tractionand visibility : no focus on I phone plan sales, Wifi devices, BCpenetration not being able to ramp up , new data site drive, BTS levelinformation to Zones3. Postpaid Consumer business deep dive has been missing for a longtimeAdarsh has to work towards better execution of large projects. He hasto influence multiple stakeholders and pull of things against the odds.He has to focus on team development to build a high performing team.Adarsh is an extremely capable telecom professional. He is very strongin fundamentals of the business. His next big leap has to be- to movefrom an individual who understands the nitty gritties of the telecombusiness ( because of the long experience in the business ) to someonewho can shape the business in newer ways. He has to take a step backand look at fault lines and opportunities. He has to view the businessfrom a distance so as to observe some long term business trends,competition strategy and consumer behavior changes and driveinitiatives towards these areas.________________________________________The year has been challenging for the circle in terms of the revenueperformance vs DB. During the first half Adarsh has developed as aprofessional and also had to handle the function for almost 3 months inthe absence of the marketing head.What went well -The RMS gain has been more or less in line - normalising for any of theaccounting changes done by Airtel. The work done in the 3rd and 4thquarter of last year has started showing results in terms of the Aircelslowdown. RPM corrections of the base have also helped the revenueline. Importantly there has been some movement towards changing the wayof working - particularly in the area of market and consumer connect.Also the execution focus has seen a lot more emphasis. Data businesswas a good story in the first quarter and has been one of the mainstays of the business so far. Also - important for the function -Adarsh has been able to work well with other functions and in generalthis is one feedback that has been coming in - a lot more collaborativeapproach from the marketing team.What could have been better -While there has been a slowdown on voice, there needed to have been somemore efforts in finding out what areas of this business can be impactedto get that much more. Also the overall postpaid business -particularly the voice part can be deep dived into a lot more so thatthere is a quicker response to problems. While Adarsh has been workingon the nitty gritties of the business, once in a while it will help ifhe steps back, takes the view of the business from a distance so as toobserve some long term trends on consumer behaviour and startidentifying areas of opportunities which are of a sustainable naturebased on strong consumer insights, which is one area where there issome distance to travel."

"Rajat has been performing his tasks well and has been able to improve onthe Core KPI's of the Kolkata circle. Below are some of the Hits & howhe has performed the same.All BC & GCS version upgraded to 12B.Other regular upgrades completed on timeProper capacity planning and projections are done during bugeting andcommissioning of 250k VLR completed as per DB.Switch KPI's mianly ASR and PSR improved. Specialy PSR which was low forall E/// circles improved by 1% post the call precedence patch rollout.The first time MTX audit was carried out successfully.Played an active role in the NT- HLR migration.Personal involvement at the time of crisis and hand holding the team isdone in a proper manner, Timely decision taken during crisis moment hadhelped in resolving issues in a timely manner and doing away withrevenue loss. All node utilization and links were below threshold yproper monoitoring of the same.Misses and how misses :Kolkata Core ranking further degraded due to increase in customercomplaints per lac subs. The increase in complaint is due to new SOGimplementation where a no. of enquiries are tagged as complaints andthere are no solutions that can be provided by the CS team as most ofthem are remote end issue.It was taken up with corportae and after a lot of follow ups the numberhas been reduced considerably.Migration to Sigtran - all BC to STP connectivities were to be migrtaedover Sigtran from TDM however the same is delayed due to commercialissues raised by E/// and migration to the new HLR .Developments:Needs to work on how to improve on fitness to stay regular at office.Effort for maintaining the same is seen lagging at times.Personal initiative is to be shown in taking on new projects oradditional responsibilities which builds the step towards a higherrole.New feature and statistics are expected to be compared before and afteran upgrade - which is done on reminders.Being irregular often sets a not so comfortable situation in front ofthe team. Hence special focus needs to be given on physical fitness andregularity.Visibility is to be improved and needs to build on presentation skills."
"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Sanjay's biggest achievement in FY15 has been, that he along with thesegment & Service delivery teams has co-ordinated the implementation ofthe WBSEDCL project very well. The project is almost at the completionstage & kudos to Sanjay for contributing immensely in this mammothproject.

"What Hits :Vijendra have managed the TERM compliance well and we have been meetingcompliance through out the year!!!. Also the de duping process ,telecalling & FCR are managed well to keep the base clean . Similarlyhis strength has always been in operating the softage team as mouldthem as per the circle requirement . The volume that increased in last4 months are almost 50% and the TAT was almost at par to the normalmonths. the timely IMEI analysis and regulatory reports / reviews havealso helped in keeping the base clean. He has ensured to handle histeam well without any impact on activities when there was noreplacement. Also the submission of data base have always been on time. Additionally he is been given the responsibility of postpaidactivations, number management and welcome letter processing. Vijendrahas always been open in taking new activities .How Hits :The well managed timely visit and coordiantion with TERM have helped himto have a robust relation. His IMEI analysis have helped the circle alot in getting base cleaned up. Also the MIS on wrong documention tobranches and getting the FIR registered the retailer have put a lot ofpressure on distribution team. The regular updations of forgeddocumentation to field & Zonal heads have also helped in keeping thedocumentation clean. The recent activity of flasing prepaid qualityreport has helped to keep the business updated on the quality ofacquisition done month on month.What Miss :Vijendra have not focused on postpaid data base clean up and also therelevant MIS to field and Retail on the same have beena miss. The UB toEV target is not met . there is no proactive dialogues done with CSheads and Softage to curb issues or taken any initiative in the year.Data entry is still a miss and managing the correctness of data base isstill a struggle. There is no timely update of escalations. Vijendrahas not involved himself in any projects either nationally or atcircle. There have been no innovation or new ideas put to table forincreasing the business efficiency . Also the best practice fromKolkata circle which was shared by corporate was not replicated.How Misses:Vijendra lacks proactiveness and initiatives. There is no proactive MIS,project , analysis that is done on his behalf and regularly falshed toimprove performance. He always needs reminders and follow ups oncritical matters. he has not been giving enough time to field and tosoftage process to correct them proactively. His reaction to toughsituation is not appreaciated by CS heads .Overall, Vijendra is good in handling TERM and is been doingeffectively. However as a Manager, he lacks proactiveness, initiativetaking ability and his commitment to close the open issues.vijendra will have to be more active and stern with his team when itcomes to delivery within traget timeline.

Infra uptime of Strategic andnon-strategic sites has met targets. It's a matter of pride thatGujarat is leading in OP RNA amongst all circles since Oct, and we areamongst the top 3 in CP RNA. The flood situation in Baroda and thecyclone preparedness of the circle was very well coordinated.Good coordination was done with BSNL to improve the uptime of USO sitesto 99.5.Outage reconciliation now meeting the target deadline set for the monthfor smooth invoicing and SLA credits.The 250 site Indoor to Outdoor conversion is now giving good saving of1.2 crores.Most of the targets on PLVA/TLVA for own sites have been achieved.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performanceAbout 4-5 USO sites of BSNL still need to be driven and achieveavailability targets for them as well.3G spares procurement (due to central guidelines) is a miss due to whichsome of the Project material has been used up for Operations andMaintenance causing shortage in Projects.PLVA to be completed on 3 sites which is pending due to owner issue.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours)You have driven the partner teams quite hard, notable amongst them beingIndus and Nokia for achieving targetsand getting the due deliverable from them.

Even in the monsoonseason the uptime was quite high during this year. You need to ensurethat this trend continues. You have been able to achieve goodcoordination with the IP and Active infra partners on a month-on-monthbasis. Good amount of work has happened in identifying the frequentlyfailing sites. You need to step up the rectification efforts on theseFF sites by pushing the appropriate partner. The sign-offs are seen tobe coming in a timely manner as well and invoice generation andchecking has been carried out well. You need to guard against the dipin performance of the USO site through constant follow up with BSNLauthorities. A close eye needs to be kept on the R&R on the sparesfront especially given the fact that spares procurement has beendelayed by the central office. Very good work has happened on theidentification of the FCU sites. For H2 please ensure that we reach theassigned target for opex savings thereby. The good work on HSW front,KRCC, guard rails and access ladders needs to continue. You need tostep up efforts on getting the remaining Vodafone own sites compliantquickly. For H2 you need to concentrate on the TLVA/PLVA and drive thepartners accordingly."

Also he is goodat cross functional interactions. He has displayed good crossfunctional support. He comes out as a good assertive manager who alsounderstands the others' point of view and regularly provides businesscritical inputs.

He is the most important binding factor for the variousFinance verticals.He has developed a good team. He has also been instrumental inrebuilding the circle FP&A team with a lot of new members gettingon-board. Also, there had been critical tenures wherein the full teamwas not available..during such occasions Parimal had worked very hardand had ensured that the absence do not impact on the deliverables .During the year, at least 4 MTs have passed from under Parimal's domainand all have been ingrained with a very good sense of the business kpisand understanding. While Parimal has been working towards building up astrong and motivated team, which is self sustaining and ever peppedup...he should also focus upon effective delegation and should improveupon the review mechanism. The period under review has been a difficultperiod from the financial deliveries point of view. As a result, therehas been a tremendous and regular pressure throughout the year. This,coupled with EVO transition (where FPnA under Parimal has also taken anadditional JD of budget reviewer), strong focus on capex & inventorymonitoring, intermittent resource gaps, planning exercise, monthlyreportings and submissions Parimal has handled all these exceedinglywell. Areas which can be further improved would include proactiveanalysis (graduate from information analyser), more & more activeinsights with business relevant solutions and timely & unbiased focuson business critical kpis . A lot of good work has been done and somemore would be the game - changer some of such areas include proactive &timely insights around acquisition quality, postpaid business , data,post launch analysis, zonal cuts of performance. Also active engagementwith zones would further help..for eg engagement around Weststarperformance. With EVO convergence, Parimal can play a very importantrole in cost controls and can be instrumental in mindset change of theusers which would propel the circle towards better efficiency. Overall,Parimal is performing very well and is headed in the rightdirection..he needs to continue building upon this good work."

"Overall Appreciation for performance:Kirti has been successful in managing the Jamnagar branch operationsthroughout last year. Considering it was the first full year of salesoperations coming from a core CS back ground, Kirti has bettered hisunderstanding on the distribution space & has also lead the teamtowards overall target achievements. Under Kirti leadership Jamnagarmaintained a consistent edge over competition there by ensuring GASleadership month on month. Overall Kirti was successful in handling thebranch operations & managing the team to overall company's objective.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:- UB target achievement of 105% against 95% of the circle.- Tertiary ach of 89% against 80% of Gujarat. This also is the highestachievement among all branches- Quality acquisition with T3M@72% against 66% of Circle.- M-Pesa was a Hit throughout the year in both thru-put & acquisition.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Following are the areas where Kirti has missed to achieve the desiredlevels:- Distribution parameters. UEO, UAO & DSO- MNP leadership.- Postpaid acquisition from store.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Kirti has been able to ensure a robust review mechanism on thedeliverables & has managed to align his team to the overall prioritiesof the organisation. Jamnagar has been a strong market for Ideahistorically but after the first 2 months the team ensured a consistentGAS leadership throughout the year. This was possible by laying downstrong distribution on ground & focusing on market segmentation.Vistaar has been a major contributor in Jamnagar which has been backedby timely resizing there by appointing new AD's well on time & ensuringtraction as per norms.Continuous drive on the acquisition front has led Jamnagar attain theGAS leadership from last 4 months & Kirti has also managed to hold onto the CMS for the branch which now should see an upward trend. Theactivation were not done at the cost of the quality & thus all qualityparameters are well above the circle benchmark with T3M @ 74%.This has been done by focusing the 1% & 10% contribution from tradewhich is also well with in norms.Kirti has also been able to drive the team to ensure distribution spreadat the 1000 plus town level there by staying above the circle average.Though there was a big challenge on 3G interference in Jamnagar forquite a long time but Kirti did manage to drive his team towards higherrevenues especially the 3G. The tertiary ach of Jamnagar is 89%compared to that of the Circle of 80%. Adequate stock levels at DD/SD &trade, New 3G town launch, retail awareness on data products &promotions were some of the highlights for the tertiary ach.M-Pesa was one of the highlight for the Branch & the performance hasbeen good right from the start of this new business. Kirti has alwaysbeen ensuring the due focus in M-pesa & setting up high targets for thebranch. His continuous drive & direction to the M_pesa BDM has takenthe branch to a thruput figure of 1cr thus becoming the 2nd branch todo so. The performance on Agent participation & customer acquisitionhas also been better off compared to that of other branches.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):The distribution KPI's was a complete miss. More efforts could havebeen put in driving the distribution numbers. Jamnagar city needsserious correction in UAO which is a matter of concern & this will alsohelp in building a storng share in the city market.MNP story is a MISS too. The performance is also not par with that ofcircle average. IDEA on a continuous basis is reporting higher port inthan Vodafone which is a cause of concern. Though some improvement isreflected in last couple of months but considering this as one of thestrong distribution pillars, much more intensity is required in termsof driving MNP port ins. Higher retailer participation (MNPO) willfurther help us achieve the MNP leadership in Jamnagar.Postpaid acquisition from Jamnagar store needs to see an uplift as theperformance has been struggling on a consistent basis.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Kirti needs to continue driving strong fundamentals & drive the team tooperational efficiencies. We must ensure a clear leadership in thebranch on that too on a weekly basis. Jamnagar city to be pulled upmajorly in the distributions KPI's which further will help in bettertraction. Must start aiming at 25% GAS for the branch.The post-paid business needs to see better traction specially thebusiness from the store considering the VMS & VBS have starteddelivering better in last few months & looks to be coming on track.Kirti is one extremely mature professional & reflects a clear sense ofresponsibility in his day to day operations. One suggestion on apersonal front that Kirti needs to aim for some wins like Zonathonwhich will surely be a booster for the branch. Kirti needs to increasehis visibility at the senior management & should interact more duringsuch forms there by sharing initiatives & best practices if any."

"Santu has had focus on the postpaid nos constantly, works on getting theproductivity of stores higher. Holds sessions with the team from timeto time, holds zonal meetings and has trained sales executives, teamassists, cashiers and the smart crew at least one every qtr to alignthe sales techniques, understanding of products and creating new salespitches. DB targets have been achieved but OG/AOP Net target will be amiss for this year. Santu and the stores team has done a brilliant jobon red launch and loop acquisitions. Concalls were held in the last qtrto keep the rigour on revenue up. Focus on existing stores to delivermore or same productivity . One on one with these managers were heldbut needed to be done consistently. Targets of these stores needed tobe aligned accordingly and productivity per execs needed to bemonitored and improved. Sales assist productivity and categorizationreview monthly would have assisted the same.DAQ has been a good improvement mainly due to red and other bundledpacks. Santu has diven the same constantly. Unfortunately the targetfor the year was 80%.USB sales have been low across the circles as customers are movingtowards one device to be the answer to all their needs.MI performance though highest in the country is a miss by 11 % thisyear.. Smart crew reviews, payouts needed to be done monthly to ensurethe focus is on. Hiflier needed to be modified timely to ensure targetsare achieved month on month. Store managers needed to be aware of theirnos weekly to ensure the month end pressure is lesser. Just being bestin the country is not a reason for Mumbai stores not to achievetargets. This has also resulted in achieving only 46% of stores beingmore than 20% EBITDA +ive.Deep dive on quality of acquisition was needed. Reasons for salesreversals needed to be analyzed and learnings to be shared with theteam. Processes rolled out needed to be adhered too. Audits and checkson the same would have assisted to curb the incorrect reconnections.Analysis of products which inculcate habits of use-n-throw needed to bemodified and products that create more stickiness needed to beintroduced.While super fast activations were monitored closely at the start of theyear, the momentum was lost after a couple of months. It was anexcellent initiative which died as the drive and conviction behind itwas missing. Syncpro was introduced in the business to facilitate thesame but was not extracted to its optimum. No quarterly reviews wereheld with Syncpro to align the processes or plug the gaps and iron outthe issues.By March end, 26 out of 36 stores would move into the +ive EBITDA zone.VS would also need 55 lacs to move stores into the 20% + positiveposition. While there has been a lot of work on data sales, drive tosell iphones and red tariffs, Loop acquisitions, we missed this target.The miss has been a culmination of SR's, MI targets and missing thepostpaid nos in the 1st and 2nd qtr.. Even the delay new store rollouts have caused the same. For new store, the preparedness with staff45 days earlier has resulted in comparatively slow start. New storeslike Dahisar and Juhu have pulled the new store productivity down too.Though Santu had one on one sessions with managers and retail leads espof stores pulling te performance down, the same was done only in H2,this atleast helped in achieving the OG Gross target and the DBtargets.Post the logistics vertical moved under Santu, he has analyzed the P&Lsheet of the stores with a ""fine-tooth-comb"". He consistently came upwith suggestions to reduce costs and ensured that any wastage ofmanpower, indents , expenses are all stopped or curbed."

"A)Trade EngagementPuneet has worked diligently on building the retail segmentation blocksof 11 and 21 which remained as cornerstone of our acquisition gameplan. There was an addition of 50 buckets as well. Mid Year there wasa complete revamp of the Super Star program to which Puneet played acrucial part in meaningful analysis and creating the entire programalong with marketing team. He kept on creating offers for retailersunder this category.

He didwork on various processes along with CS and there was some streamliningdone as well. However, he could have done better to get pre-paid Netleadership by involving himself with the field and getting thoseincremental no's for Punjab to be consistent MNP positive.HSW :Did well as an element leader for Rules and Standard for Sales andMarketing Function.

"Hits: Priya is a good team player and engages well with the team. Someof the hits for Priya during the year has been the new initiatives thatshe worked upon - Vodafone Corner, Red Club, Pulse 8, etc. The QoFSIfor the SME team has been a feather on the cap wherein the circletopped the national charts consistently for majority of the months.Misses: there have been quite a few misses in the service team - churn %vs DB has been the most important one. While we agreed during the MYPDthat large contribution to the churn had come from the government IOIP( due to rate hardening ), clear action plan was chalked out to reducethe churn - unfortunately none of them got implemented.Fixed line delivery continued to be a miss despite multipleinterventions - inability to grasp the product and its dependenciesacross the board led to the gap.Lack of depth in understanding the numbers and analytics led to nonaction on multiple fronts including churn management.Way forward in Q1:1. Focus on churn management - get to the root cause of the problem andintroduce corrective action at each step including the telecalling setup for preventing churn - need proactive approach than reactive2. Automation is the need of the hour - proactively identify theproblems being faced in the zones and work towards automating theprocesses - "" project Top 10 Problems""3. Drive traffic towards call center, EBO, ESS, My World, Vodafonecorner in order to free the SMs so that they could focus on moreproactive effort4. Streamline FLD delivery by identifying the bottlenecks in thedelivery process and with clear focus and priority for large deals andsignificant projects"

Gandhidham Zone registered a revenue growth of26% YOY which is a highlight thus beating the revenue targets for theyear. Pratiyush also managed to retain all his BIG accounts with noteven a single account churn to competition there by ensuring a verystrong rapport with all key stake holders.One of the biggest wins for the year was Jindal Saw which was churnedfrom Airtel with 600 COCP lines & revenue of 4M.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:- Overall Revenue for VBS was a success story with over achievement inall segments & 103% target vesus achievement. Revenue targets wereachieved for all segments barring NC with 90%. For VGE, GOG & SME thetargets were over achieved. VGE - 103%, GoG - 103%, SME - 119%.- This made the revenue grew at 26% YOY- Biggest competition account was acquired i.e Jindal Saw with approx.600 COCP lines & a revenue of 4M.- Gandhidham zone is the best in terms of FLD acquisition in Atlas andGolddust projects with the OB Value of 1.6 Mn.- The SME Atlas OB achvt is at 1588% and the revenue achievement is at137%.- Pratiyush also managed to enhance the revenue of Top accounts. Welspun(15% ), Adani (11% ), AMW ( 150%) , ABG Cements ( 15% ), Sanghi ( 20%),- All major accounts were well managed with no Churn.- New account acquisition was a HIT too for the year.- Growth in sub base from 74k to 100k.- Pratiyush has been able to manage his team very well there byreflecting the Vodafone values of Speed, Simplicity & Trust.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:- SME performance has been a BIG miss for the year with very littleimprovement.- NC revenue @ 90%- FLD OB was a miss primarily in NC segment with 22% achievement.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Though there are limited opportunities in Kutch as most of the bigaccounts are already with Vodafone but Pratiyush with the help ofaccount remapping managed to churn good competition accounts likeGallant Metals, Gimpex, TATA etc which helped great deal both inacquisition & revenue front.With his continuous follow up & some great rapport building with the keydecision makers in Jindal Saw, Pratiyush was also successful in winningthe biggest Airtel account with gave a good increase in revenue withalmost 4M annually.Some good work was also done in GOG segment & getting big deals likeNRHM ( 700 COCP ), SSA ( 300 Dongles), ICDS ( 100 IOIP ), JMC ( 200IOIP ). Also business from existing account was made sure & most of themajor accounts were retained with a minimal revenue drop & by ensuringexcellent rapport & by giving best of the service to the existingaccounts. Pratiyush made sure that not even a single account was lost.Pratiyush & his team also managed to convert 43 accounts from Hunting toFarming category.

Both his old FFM's got transferred &Pratiyush made sure that there is no impact in the business.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):SME acquisition was a major miss for the year largely because of thereach issue. Dependency on one channel partner has been an issue thruout which now has been taken care off.The infra was a BIG miss here & Pratiyush missed finding the rightchannel to drive this business. A much more aggression was requiredconsidering the kind of potential & the opportunity that the SME has instore in Gandhidham Branch. Areas like Samakhayli, Bachau, Mundra etccontinue to be a miss in the SME presence.Pratiyush need to take immediate correction so as to stream line the SMEoperation in Gandhidham which is currently lagging big time. SMEacquisition at 58% is a major issue though some correction have beenseen in last 2 months post appointing a new channel at Anjar & 2 DSTappointment also.NC revenue was @ 96% largely because of the Top accounts whosecontribution is more than 50% & their plans had to be revised so as toretain them.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Pratiyush has managed to do well in overall aspect of the businessconsidering the changes in his team during the year & the challengesthat the territory hold. His immediate focus has to be on the SMEvertical which has resulted to a downfall last complete year. He mustensure a required correction in the SME infra & a complete presence forgenerating the business.Also with the addition opportunities coming up in Mundra , Pratiyushneed to be fully prepared in all aspects & be proactive.On the other front Pratiytush needs to keep working on his strengthswhich is team handling, strong people management & very good accounthandling.Pratiyush also need to be more visble at the cricle level for which hemust take few initiavtives which can be replecated across other areasas well."

"General: While Satish is very good at conceptualizing and is alsopassionate for his deliverables he has to continue to drive the fieldand the support functions till he achieves the desired results, heshould not get disappointed with failures but use them as tool toidentify the mistakes and correct them.What : Subscriber/Revenue/High Value ChurnHow : While this year has seen unprecedented churn figures on account ofsystem/people issues some new initiatives have also been launched. Themajor reasons of churn have been rate hardening, wrong reactivations,network issues, manpower availability and agency payout structure.Invol agencies. The accountability of Retail team in retaining customersis not visible in spite of the service lead of retail in place who hasdotted line reporting to circle CS head. Conduct a Churn review withall stake holders like CnC, Mktg, Retail, Sales & Finance to bringabout a change in the churn numbers and sustain from there. Createvisibility on MNP offers in this forum along with availability offeedback from CnC, penetration of goodies from VF stores for retentionand the reasons, numbers and efforts put in by retail team on Vol andP2P cases. While High value churn is a critical item in the national CSscorecard a new MIS to bring seriousness on this subject got startedtowards the end of Oct. Get into detailing on feedback for every MSISDNand cross check the feedback with support from the PACE setup fromwhere you can get independent feedbacks.While some initiatives like handling of P2P from VMS at backend callcenter, 8 seats for handling P2P from VF stores needs to continue andgrow from here.What: VRM - Prepaid/PostpaidHow: Prepaid VRM was a great initiative which could have been handledbetter and grown to make it a national benchmark but because ofmanpower constraints team could not focus much on this. With DECCcoming in place keep a close eye on the experience given to high endprepaid customers. Postpaid VRM has been stable but the churn figuresof this setup has huge fluctuations which should be controlled withbetter monitoring and analysis by the team. The relations team haddreamt big on m-pesa, red acquisitions, VRDA etc but the deliver wasnot upto the expectations. The relations lead of the circle has alsobeen working from baroda which has added to the low performance by thisteam.What: Projects, Customer Day, Engagement eventsHow: This team is great bunch of people and should devote some time toideate on new ideas and methods to deliver performance by influencingother verticals and departments. Customer day was a big miss initiallyinspite of reminders and is conducted regularly now. While there wasshortage of budgets in conducting Let's meet and little strokes theteam delighted customers with IPL tickets and tickets for the KapilSharma show in Surat etc. The team also distributed tickets tocustomers for the navratri event.

Retail engagement2. Innovation and creativity3. Sales support4. Content and customer centric5. DB achievementTushar comes from a strong background of content and vas , therby hisframe of reference is very strongly pro-customerYes the DB has been achieved of data and for VAS it is at 97/98 % and Icongratulate Tushar on delivering on this line itemTushar has built a very strong credibility with the sales team by makinga continuous dialogue with the sales team and I commend him forbuilding that relationship with the teamsVery creative and innovative to the approach, Tushar always attempts tobring the customer angle while problem solvingA lot of trade activation has been done from Tushar's thoughts , and alot of success on VAS has come from such creativity and retailengagementAreas of improvement1. Daily operations - DRR drive on input parameters has been very weak ,daily tertiary , pack attachments, data pack sale and data FR driveshave been weak, this is core to the business and this has been a miss2. Postpaid projections - postpaid as a part is not Tushar's forte,however it is his responsibility and he needs to pick this piece up ina big way , right from projections to pack retention . the UNR piecefor postpaid is Tushar's own KPI and has been a miss , also after2years in a role one cannot go by ""lack of strength "" in a KPI3. Focus on input parameters, than output - big area to build4. Stretch targets - while the DB was achieved the expected growth ratewas not as per expectations , every circle has punted of data and thesame has not happened .5. Process and operational improvements - we have faced huge amounts ofissues of process gaps and the same were not picked faster and resolvedCase in point - downloads/ postpaid USSD based activation / new postpaidproducts / prepaid activation tats on recharge/ new innovation vs. idea6. Team drive and handling - Tushar is a go getter and is aself-starter,but as a team manager one is only that ""good"" as good theteam is .Tasking and capability building could be have been better , Tushar has ayounger team and he can really influence their learning curve by righttasking . he needs to be on top of their expectations and aspirations.8. Key KPI ""last mile"" - DTO, 3G town, postpaid data UNRKey KPIs like DTO, 3G town launch and review etc have been ""missed"" dueto no deep diving to improveNew business grow at a very fast rate , exceptional performance canreally make a big dent vs. comp9. trends understanding and reaction - vs comp- our UUs were dropping since march april , so were revenues- Network was a pain earlier, however aggression was not built- Competition launches products and we are not 1st mover, thought ondata as to how and where do we wish to take this was missed- prepaid dongle, mifi, public wifi, 3g lite , 121 integration , 121segmentation are missed opportunities which should have come last year10. customer insighting was the biggest miss - initiatives like GMATwere shelved and not built onCustomer insight was not doneYouth program could have been started earlier and same when given toMeenal was not driven , that is a gold mineDevelopment goals- wish to showcase Tushar as the ""pioneer"" in the content revolutionfor Vodafone- deliver on DB from month 1 via operational rigour1. Drive content revolution in gujarat2. Deliver DNA supremacy over ideaWill discuss future goals and aspirations with Tushar , however I thingis certain a great delivery in the current year would really providethe strong boost needed for incremental growths"
"APDHas good understanding of the business & brings in a micro-managementapproach with the sales team. Is a quick learner as was evident duringthe earlier periods.Business performance for VAS portfolio is ahead of DB , largely lead byData , but other line items of SMS and traditional VAS are also ahead.Ershad has led his team well and ensured higher than DB performance.Data has really grown well and 3g adoption in the circle is ahead ofother ICR circles and has been used well.Various segmented offers were launched and have helped in data adoption.Overall performance exceeds expectation. , but Ershad needs to spendmore time on other VAS verticals to draw more from SMS and VASportfolio."

"Some good initiatives taken in the last year include Shatabdi trainbranding , m-pesa BTL activation , support for new store launch , 3Gnew town launch program , excellent PR coverage throughout the year ,high decibel local ABJ campaign , navratri sponsorships and IPLexecution.Big misses include no engagement plan , events / property for buildingemotional connect with the customers , struggle on AVI scores inspiteof huge investments on merchandising agency. Also most of the creativework was delayed and timely execution was an issue. No innovation wasdone in the OOH execution. This led to low NPS / AVI scores.Overall brand visibility across vistaar markets is an issue.While Neeru has shown 100% dedication and commitment towards her work ,she needs to go a long way in getting in-depth understanding of circlelevel operational activities . She is yet to get hold of all marcomresponsibilities and is not able to work independently on the entiremarcom portfolio. She needs to work on team management. In manyinstances , team is not aligned to the overall objective of the companydue to gap in communication and understanding of the team.Need to improve speed to market and understanding of marcom operationsin totality. Currently it is limited to PR , creative agency dealing.To achieve the company objectives, she needs to demonstrate speed tomarket & improve understanding of the business in the next 3months."

"As new face to the Vodafone family, Vikas displays Vodafone behaviourialcompetencies and values at most of the times.His strength lies in Applied Thinking. He comes across as a curiousprofessional who gets to the root causes, finds parallels andcontrasts.As the performance pressure mounts, he starts buckling which seems to bean improvement area.

"Dhanya has brought a new thought process and energy in the data team.Though a big team with unclear roles to start with, she has been ableto visualize and put together a comprehensive action plan for each teammember. Dhanya has envinced her interest to do an operations role asher next move. One thing she would like to consciously work on shouldbe to develop her first line and try to delegate more work to them.Though there have been challenges in adopting that route, however, shewould need to really work towards itAPD commentsDhanya has been instrumental in bringing together disparate energiesprevalent around data theme for the circle. It ranged from getting themarket connect right to bringing more energy and urgency in executionof ""data first and voice second"" theme across the zones. She was alsoable to beautifully complement data GTM plans with her previousbackground of acquisition and U&R.Here are the hits which for this financial year- 121 became more symbolized with data offers then voice. It not onlyhelped in increasing the unique user base but also data adoption- Large screen play - MBB sales just multiplied, primarily from prepaidwhere there was an exclusive product proposition which was communicatedto the market- Various touch points like IBCC/ OBCC and retail stores were tapped toupsell data products which now form close to 5-7% of data revenue- Launched successful team engagement programs like DPL, displaycontest, KDO schemes, data star and others- Launch of 3g towns and driving 3g LUT programCouple of misses which I would like to mention are:- DB revenue both on prepaid and postpaid. Though I would like tomention that TN data team has done an exception work in terms of 3Gdata growth and has been nationally recognized as well- Dhanya will have to really work towards making the team moreself-sufficient. Though she recognizes the fact, however, it wouldrequire a substantial effort from her end to lead the team that way- Last but not the least, Dhanya would have to have a quarter view whiledevising data strategy for the circle- Driving HBO agenda from our end was a miss. Though there wereinteresting interventions which were carried out like USSD, collateralshowever, it failed to become a well-knit and comprehensive program"

It's thecommitment and effort from Munish that helped rolling out Thomas cookas the travel partner in our circle. This I'm sure like all change willtake more time and effort to stabilize as we now need them to managecar hire & stay arrangements too under the centralization.Zone and branch offices have been refurbished in line with thestandards, this reflected in the positive employee experience andfeedback. Most of the processes are being streamlined with continuedfocus on property portfolio rationalization and HSW alignment.Handling Sri-Ganganagar labour issues along with Corporate Affairs guyand Amit Bhatnagar was commendable.All new initiatives towards HSW implemented with passion and aggressionlike passport, fire audit action on mystery audit etc.How Hits:Good knowledge and soled background helped him in handling his portfoliowell. He is quite open to take-on challenges and demonstrates can-doattitude for anything suggested/ demanded.Possess good attitude towards people and hence interpersonal relationswith all stakeholders is very good which helped him to managedisagreements well. Good in handling ambiguity and able to givesdirections to his team in crisis.What Misses:100% control and confidence on all the processes is yet to beestablished, hence the surprises are surfacing on a regular intervalslike payment of extra wages to Check-mate etc.Though a lot is happening around energy savings but still there are manyopportunity and more to happen.Attention is required to ensure payments are processed timely. Therehave been too many issues of delayed vendor payments and not alwaysit's due to the SSC delay.Personal audits of HSW are not done and, hence, persuasion to others isnot happening in a structured manner. SMT are not tracked andmonitored.How Misses:At time, find difficulty in handling / removing bottlenecks and getsstuck if other stake-holders are not supporting.Afraid of challenging the status quo and experimenting with the new waysof doing things.Not very organized and conduct structured review of his team.Development Need :During the coming months, special attention are require on:Vendor managementCompliance to the Fast Forward projectConsidering our continued focus on cost savings, during the next 6months it is important to ensure rationalization of Housekeeping andsecurity HC without compromising on the service or premises security,safety requirements.Employee's experience and stakeholder management should continue byhanding their concerns proactively.More focused approach requires towards institutionalizing HSW practices.Munish has brought Energy Saving in the offices with proper awarenessand engagement with employeesAPDMunish has successfully transitioned security vendor which helped savingcost of Security. He managed the vendor and stakeholders effectivelyduring this transition. Munish with help of team worked consciously tosave Electricity Cost across the offices.

Munish needs to proactively work for propertyupgradation/change where the renewal is going to be due in next month.Tie up with different facilities has been developed in JAIPUR, howeverthere is scope of further tie up with other facilities and take suchtie up in other cities as well. Hotel tie up at Upcountry Location andfacility support to new joiners should be priority in the coming time.Munish needs to challenge status quo of facility very often and shouldpush his own boundary. He should display 'Can Do' approach and shouldbelieve challenging and developing himself.Governance around Travel Cost should have been strengthen during theyear to reduce the wastage which has been started from Feb.Hygiene parts of cafeteria was managed well, however the delight ismissing. Munish helped in introducing dry pantry at Zone/Branch.Proactive Maintenance of ACs and other equipment have been taken careof. Some of the mega events - West Star and Sirmur Cup went well withthe help of Admin Team. Munish needs to conduct the analysis ofFacility cost regularly and present it to stakeholders. He shouldremove the dependency of Cab on one vendor and should deploy 2ndvendor.Guest House has been maintained efficiently and is working wellHSW Newsletter needs to be more regular and with quality input. 2W DDTraining and ETU could have reviewed regularly.Munish needs to increase visibility and acceptance of HSW across thecircle.Munish should take up initiative around HSW which will increase thevisibility around the area."

"Overall Appreciation:Nagesh , you have been handling this role for over 2 years now, and withyou at the helm of affairs, R & R has seen a lot of positive changes inthe way it functions. Not only has a lot of structure come in the teamsworking, but, also the team today is a healthy mix of experience,maturity & assertiveness. Growth has happened, team members have movedto bigger roles, and most of all, the Relation team has shown signs ofstability. What was good in you- follow ups, meeting timelines- youhave retained, and during the course of the year, have grown as aprofessional, maturing further in the current role!Comments on KPIs:ON number & revenue churn, versus a DB target of 2.05%, the circle hasdelivered 2.37%. While there have been concerns on account of bigaccounts porting out, things still can be streamlined. April was bad,however, there was no reason for May to be bad on Number & Value churn.Team productivity should have been tracked stringently, and not even asingle day should have gone without questioning people onnon-performance.One, over the last FY, and YTD, the team needs to let go of the conceptof Bulk Churn. Targets have to be tracked, using back ward calculation,if required.Team needs to get back to basics, and this, you need to drive. By 5 thof every month, calculation , on an excel sheet, needs to come in. Thismust include segment wise WIN BACKs & Corporate names from wherein,numbers are expected.Platinum churn needs to be tracked separately, and RTL needs to own upthe same. Currently, they have started driving numbers, in totality,and there is no specific effort on Platinum segment. The same hasimpacted the value churn achievement to an extent, and versus a targetof 2.05%, we have achieved 2.09%... a very small margin to miss!Post to pre-need to be worked upon. This count has gone over the roof,and field teams are not working on the same. Somewhere, importance ofretaining customers on Post-paid needs to be reiterated to the teams.This is hitting us on Value churn. My suggestion is to start sharingimpact of Value churn on account of Post to Pre with the Zonal Heads toeducate them on the same. Situation needs to be controlled, because ourP2P from an averahe 800/month is in excess of 2000/month over thecourse of this FY versus last FYGood work thus far on the Relations Vertical.The way HNI churn has been controlled, speaks a lot about the level ofinteraction happening with the customer baseAppreciate the turnaround performance on HNI bad debt piece and happy tosee Bad debts under 1% markNow that you have got a mature, seasoned team, it is time that HNI teamstarts adding revenue to the circle billing/revenue growthProduct and service penetration needs to be measured going forwardAlso, from an individual relationship management, the team should nowmove to a household concept, aiming to get families of HNI customersaon boardOne thing, which still leaves a lot to be desired is the way our HNIbase is being engaged. The same needs to undergo a lot of change, andfrom an impromptu engagement, it needs to be executed in a morestructural format, involving all critical stakeholders, and definitelythe CLTOn health check, a great thing is the regularity with which the same ishappening.However, as mentioned in the mid year , a desirable out-put of the sameis what needs to be tracked, and give a belief to the field teams onthe relevance of this activity.Matching of Health check visit remarks with AON Wise churn should havebeen done, which would have put an equal amount of answerability on theField Retention teams in case a health check visit account churn out in4-6 months or less than 1 year. The same has not happened till nowGoing forward, a robust process around negatively verified accountsduring Health Check visits needs to be worked upon, in agreement withbusiness stakeholdersGreat work in closing the retention outsourcing piece!The same has helped in dealing with manpower concerns @ zones veryeffectively.Health of Retention is a basic deliverable/Expectation, around whichsensitivity needs to be built, by constant follow up. The same,unfortunaly is a clear cause of concern.Nagesh, Aao Milan, has been a grand success! You have driven it withpassion, and complete ownership displayed by you. Also appreciate thefantastic coordination with commercial, closing the agency, with zonaland retail teams!What also needs to be done is the end to end tracking and defining ofsome measurable outputs from this activity. While, initially, there wasan effort on tracking walk-ins, Vodafone/non Vodafone customers, leadgeneration & conversion, the same was not regular.Another expectation is collection of concrete VOC which can help uschange customer perception in those markets. Else, it stands a threatof being just another activity with little impact. Almost 1/zone hasbeen done this year. Do plan and take this figure to at least 2 / monthin next FYOn service camps, good on numbers. A lot of structure has been put inplace, including end to end activities.Nagesh, on people front, we have seen movements, in line withindividual's growth happeningAm happy to see action happening on the relations team as well. The teamfeels more involved.One area of improvement - increase your involvement with the HNI team.Putting a structured way of daily operations is the beginning, pls takeit one step ahead by increased involvement, specially, in cases ofcustomer interaction gone bad.Like we have seen growth happening in the retention team, would want tosee the same - at least for the RMs who have completed more than 2years in the same role. Please work on thisOn your developmental goals, am happy to see that you have completed theline managers training and have seen a positive change in your workingstyle post the same.On Crisis management training, will ensure that you are a part of thenext batch, as & when it is happening.On your personal aspiration, we have had a detailed discussion. And I amaware that you have expressed a desire to move to the Call centre SPMprofile. For the purpose of the same, would suggest you to take upprojects in Q1-2015 related to Call centre. Starting with Outboundprocesses will be a good idea, and I will ensure that you get fairexposure & involvement in OB projects. Gradually, then, you can move toinbound call centre projects.All the best for FY 2015-16!!"

"Sameer...it's a good beginning for the 1st half of the year & hope tohave the same momentum flow. Many notable achievements & specially theUSO collection completion and National Sourcing closure is stupendous.For year 14-15 against a saving target of 45 mn identified Rs. 53.33 mnas saving potential which is real good & this is without the NationalProcurement bit. Except in the month of Aug'14 in all month POT is>90%. In Aug it was 89.3%. This is majorly due to change of paymentdates by SSC and specific instructions from corporate for holding capexpayments.This miss so far is Savings realisation which is extremely low butlittle understandable as majority of OFC route savings will getrealised by December. Also we have missed to revisit time n again theOpen PO details & we need to put our complete focus on that. LocalMaterial procurement & deployment pattern is one area where our focushas to come inAm sure we will improve upon on areas where we are doing bad as ofnow...all the best for a successful H2.Full Year Review :As far as NW procurement be it material or services , Sameer you areabsolutely on top of it & generally you always put something extra &go for thtra extra mile whenever asked for. Closure of almost 500Kms offiber roll out speaks volume coupled with a fantastic innovation ofthat of IP cabinets which has been appreciated & implementedNationally.A. Fiber roll out closure is a major achievement this year ( almost 500Kms finalisation coupled with many small end links speak volume). B.Savings potential identification of 53 MN aginst a target of 45MN...realisation though a bit slow but surely will get achieved bymonthend C. Monitered deliveries and ensured no stock out situation.Ensured no excess ordering is done for local material. Also newordering is done only after checking stock at warehouse and getting arollout plan from NW team.D. Supervising the capex utilization &providing the MIS to user...Kepping a complete track on Servicecapitalisation & taking part of National projects.Monitoring & closure of Open PO. It's a KPI where probably because ofconstant monitoring issue we have never been able to come close to ourtarget.A.Under the VF cultural value of Speed, Sameer worked with pace andenergy & under the VF strategic value of Customer Obsessed Sameercollaborated with user (listened & asked questions to understandcustomer needs) to make sure that not only we order things on time butthe Job Completion also to happen for proper Capex realisation. B.Sameer depicted the value of SIMPLICITY by challenging whatever is notsimple,effiicient or cost effective & under the VF strategic value ofbeing Competitive Sameer demonstrated can-do attitude.We all know what we are trying to achieve as far as KPI monitoring vsbusiness is concerned, hence need to change our approach when the oldprocess is not working without compromising on values.Need to be moreinnovation hungry.While NW ordering & Capex status monitoring will remain as primaryobjective, we need to be more focussed on our KPI part a bit more.Basic KPI achievement is a must & being head of NW procurement we haveto do it going forward.Consistency is the key & need to focus on positivity & the attitudepart. Lots have changed as compared to last year which are all positive& need to carry the same forward so that by next 2-3 yrs you can comeup as the SCM head."

Hehas achieved 104% of his DB. He has high energy and often demonstratesthem in plan of action to achieve set goals, targets. He has goodknowledge of the acquisition business but he needs to alter hiscommunication style and approach with his teams. This can help himimmensely in leading his team to greater heights. He often works in ashell and has low visibility with c-level engagements both in thecircle and with customers.

He could have done better by having a robust plan in targetingkhoj accounts and upselling PRI in existing accounts. Innovative waysof handling partner sales team and sales desks in IOIP accounts was amiss. It was much seen from other channels and competition.

"Nilay has done well to sustain the momentum & further build into thisyear with a 0.6 %CMS growth & has grown equivalent to Idea growth .Over 24 month period VF has added 1.8% CMS however the CMS gap withIDEA remains constant. The Key task for Solapur is to start reducingthe CMS gap with IDEA.This is a key part of Jeet Solapur and Team Solapur needs to take upthis task with vigor, rigor and passion that is characteristic of them.The CMS growth is driven by 0.1% increase in GAS 0-120 Vs IDEA & 6%increase over the past 18 months which is a superb accomplishment. Thenext milestone is to reduce the GAS0-120 gap of 9.4% to sub 5% toeffectively start winning in this market.The current Subscriber addition momentum is aiding growth of TertiaryYoY with Solapur in Top3@24% YoY. This is again an excellent job done.Data Tertiary is also being Top 3 which is well done too.The AD expansion agenda has helped the execution team greatly and Nilaymust ensure that the Zone delivers a minimal AD<500 MRR to ensure thatthe investments are being extracted profitably.Solapur meanwhile must focus on improving their Postpaid Growth giventhey are the Lowest Zone in Gross net growth as well as postpaidRevenue growth. This feedback is recurring as was shared in the lastAPD as well wrt building Postpaid extraction, Mpesa extraction and 3Gextraction are Opportunity areas for Solapur.From a retail standpoint, Productivity of voice and mbb, is among thelowest in MnG, similarly cross sell ratio and Red acquisition is belowpar. This above is adding to Solapur retail teams earning lowerincentives in VF champions. This needs immediate improvement and focus.Striking a good balance between Prepaid execution and Postpaid executionwill help Nilay ready himself for larger roles.Focus areas would be developing leadership of DRs and DR+1.Nilay, the Ultimate Goal now is Jeet Pune as you have moved to Punewhich is a bigger role . Hope to see a rocking performance and personaldevelopment in handling a really large Postpaid business. Wish you thevery best."

"Subhajit Sen : APDSubhajit has done well with respect to Retail extraction onProductivity, Attach rate & Incentives / associate in VF Champs. WhileGoa is doing well in terms of efficiency of extraction, Goa has a lotof head room for expanding the Postpaid business by Footprintexpansion. This has been a miss over the past few quarters.On Postpaid Growth Goa has achieved a 23% growth which is a goodstandalone, however in comparison to other zones, Goa ranks bottom.This again points to loss of opportunity in Premium Leadership marketfor VF and is a key task ahead.On the Distribution front Subhajit has consolidated his team & has builta deep understanding of the Zones opportunities and challenges. Howeverthe past few quarters have been challenging for Goa. The key drivershave been our inability to bring about a 'midshift' among a Vintage setof Distributors who have enjoyed a Leadership mindset for long.The above coupled with slower Rural distribution expansion, untappedopportunities in KRO execution intensity & 'change management' agendathat has not been managed optimally has lead to weakening of VFLeadership.As a Leadership market, VF has been losing to IDEA continually on iCMSwith a leadership loss of 1.3% in LY, and a loss of 2.1% over past 24months.Subhajit has started the aggressive winback of GAS0-120 share from IDEAand has won back 1.4% share in FY 15 to end at 3.7% gap in favor ofIDEA. The Goal Goa must undertake is to build a leadership of 8%+ overIDEA in Gas 0-120 which is a typical of Ideas leadership over VF intheir markets.Goa currently figures in Bottom @14%. YoY Tertiary growth & similar inYoY Data Tertiary too.While the above need focus, Team Goa is doing exceedingly well on 3Gdata growth being in Top 3 after normalizing for sites investments.Subhajit must continue to leverage and accelerate this momentum.The key task for Goa remains to shift 'mindset' of Legacy distributorsto take an intense fight to competition in the Goa market.

Postpaid Gross add is a miss thoughit has seen a lot of drive in recent months.Prepaid and Postpaid categories have seen a lot of action this year,starting with FR hardening by end Mar'14 to variations in STD FR, VasaiSpecials, Campus Product with nationally popular Selfie campaign, 10pV2V whitelisting in idea strong geographies to 25p in selectgeographies where 43K retailers whitelisted.Postpaid saw rollout of several temporary plans to shore up the numbersfollowed by monthly spurt activities, dramatic increase in REDcontribution and getting E-Connect at the end has been the climax ofPostpaid activities. This was then supported by extension of NSAs tothe extreme delight of the Sales team.The entire activity has been suitably supported by good allocation ofresources and timely execution of dispatches.Acquisition churn has shot up in the process for which Priyajit needsget proactive on retention activities.While Priyajit has been executing new features in CYN constantly, thisproperty always needed more attention and drive from our side. Howeverthere is no denying the fact that paucity of numbers in the pool didn'thelp the cause. Priyajit needs to invest time in ensuring good spreadof CYN SIM CardsPriyajit tried very hard to replicate competition offers on MNP butdidn't get enough support. However after the matching the offer shewill have to be extra cautious to controlling the quality that theSales team brings inTo address the revenue growth requirements and to control skyhighacquisition churn, Priyajit has invested a lot of time in planning anddevising Nursery segment which is expected to deliver good resultsRetailer Engagement, New Town Launch, LUT Program, Feeder Program etcare some of the initiatives that Priyajit has worked this year and willbe primary focus of the next year.Priyajit needs to work on all the Channels and tools that we have triedto develop and evolve over a period of time. These Channel/Tools needmore attention from her. They are;1) Modern Trade2) HVA3) CYN4) Engagement5) Rural Business Development Activities6) Timely ReportsAt the individual front the ask from Priyajit remains the same;Market Visits - original target was 12 for the year actual is 4-5. Sheshould ideally take it to 2 per month this yearInvest more time to learn Postpaid. AMDOCS migration is goodopportunity to upgradeRationalise the learnings of Postaid and Prepaid and relate it toChannel/Team/Trade behaviorImprove efficiencyBest Wishes for the New (F)Year"

His willingness to learn, deliver and constantly improvisehas been commendable. He needs to gradually build his stature in thePFM fraternity and should be seen as someone who can thinkstrategically; add value qualitatively to the function.Progress on Career Aspirations:With the kind of progress and impact made in the role, he just needsto continue the momentum and strive to excel in all pertaining areas._____________________________________________APDBhaskar comes across as someone who is strong on basics of Facilitiesand Property management.My appreciation goes for him for the closure he brought the circleoffice lease agreement and closing the accounts of Fortune towers.HitsFirst major deliverable of Bhaskar was getting the circle officeregistered. He has to spend lots of time following with differentstakeholders in moving the proposal towards closure. He did anextensive work in closing the pending payment for the earlier Fortunetowers office. Bhaskar has managed the national HR heads meets for thefirst time in his role and has managed the logistics well.Bhaskar kept the image of the circle high being a good host in managingtravel plan and stay of the cricket team ( ANE/Kol/AP) landed hereduring the NCT.Bhaskar is an active member of the national admin bulletin and he playeda key role in the first release. He completed the IFM transition wellfor the circle and the retail operations. Bhaskar took the pain ofaddress the last year payment closure which were pending before hisjoining the circle.How HitsBhaskar is logical and analytical in his approach. He has tremendouspatience in follow up which was required with the registrationofficials and other key stakeholders. He is honest in his approach andcomes across as an amicable person.Bhaskar works with standard operating procedures and he is comfortableto manage task in hand with clear direction. He manages to bring in hisown value addition to the exiting operating procedures which arequalitative.Bhaskar is good with process documentation and building new process.This aptitude he has developed towards processes has been one of thekey factors in his success. Bhaskar is hands on with numbers and he hasa good approach towards budget and monitoring of the expenses.MissesFollowing points are some of the misses during the year.- Inspection of office/zones/stores on a regular basis and addressconcerns before the issue gets escalated.- Cafeteria management. Some of the basic requirements with regard tothe hygiene, look and feel of the area has been ignored during the yeartill the escalation from the business head.- Zone spocs are yet to be part of the IFM structure.- There were delays in identifying properties for the new stores in theareas of Angul, Balasore, Berhampur and cuttack.- Bhaskar should have monitored Abbhash in HSW process and could haveprovided guidance in implementation.- Bhaskar with his manpower available at the zones, could have utilizedthe resources and took the best of each individual. Zone office did notcarry the image of locations being cleaned on a regular basis.How missesBhaskar friendly approach has back fired him most of the times. Bhaskaris someone who finds it difficult to confront situation and askdifficult questions to people. Most of the times he is to himself anddoes not connect well with the members in the same office. Bhaskar needto be pushed every now and then to complete a task.Bhaskar tends to avoid conflicts and always keeps a low profile. Thishas been a bottleneck in not being interactive and walking up to peopleto get the job done. Not tracking the performance of the zonalfacilities executives may have led to the facilities and infrastructurestatus in the zonal offices.While he is strong with systems and processes, Bhaskar strong area ofdevelopment is the drive for results. Some where the entire team issettled with whatever they have been doing in the past. The team isalso getting used to the new leadership team and is taking bit of timeto fall in line with the expectations.Way ForwardBhaskar's goals for the next FY will be clearly structured with clearexpectations. He has to set clear goals for the zone admin spocs andreview the same during his monthly visits. Cost optimization andquality of infrastructure and service will be his key focus for theyear besides implementing the central projects. Stakeholders need tounderstand the deliverables of Bhaskar and he should effectivelypartner with them in addressing concerns and work on the area of theirrequirement.Development AreasFollowing are Bhaskar's development areasDrive for resultsManaging team and teams performanceAssertive behaviourEffective CommunicationI am keeping the development areas limited for better focus. We willensure that Bhaskar is exposed to training programs, both on the joband other learning interventions to develop the areas highlighted.Bhaskar being new the circle with one year experience, I will focus ondeveloping him on critical areas before we get in the careeraspirations. He will have to look at moving to a medium circle as thefirst milestone from Odisha in 18 months time.Comments from SuzzaneCompleting the circle office lease agreement registration and release ofthe old office premises were some of the achievement among others atthe circle operations level. Bhaskar has been instrumental inpublishing one edition of Operating spaces our bulletin and is workingon the next one too. Bhaskar has completed the IFM rollout and retailstores property requirements well in time.Issue with the reception and other office interior concerns as wediscussed should have been actioned quicker. Having spoken to Bhaskar,I'm sure there has been a change in his managing stile becoming moreoperation driven and focus on speed to deliver. Bhaskar needs torollout the national service partners for Guest House by April and oncefinalized the service partners for travel and security management withHC rationalization during the coming months. Disappointed to see thatthe zone spoc's are not yet a part of the IFM structure, it must becompleted in April.With the focus on cost efficiencies this year would definitely wantBhaskar to focus on reducing the G&A costs - facilities, security,utilities & travel sharing best practices and looking for opportunitiesto bring down the cost."

This has resulted Assam to reach the highest NQI in East.There is significant improvement in MCS coding scheme resulting toimproved data perception in Assam and NE . Pradipta has ensured timelysubmission of TRAI reports to the corporate for onward submission toTRAI and ensured that KPIs are within the TRAI benchmark.. Pradiptahas also ensured that improvement plan is prepared and submitted toIMRB after each SSA drive and take corrective measures whereverpossible. Pradipta has ensured that there is constant reduction incustomer complaints and as result complaints per 1000 subs improvedfrom 9 to 3. Pradipta has the ability to lead the team, plan andcommunicate the way forward and provide required coaching and guidanceto the team members in achieving the required goals.MCS utilization, cell meeting KPIs and overall NQI are improved throughcontinuous focus in worst performing cells and their rectification withcapacity addition on monthly basis. Able to maintain call drop and callblock within 1% in Assam and NE . New initiative like BCCH frequencyswap helped to improved RXQUAL to 98.17 in NBH and 89.34 in BBH inAssam. TenXc swap in Agartala and Shillong helped the RF NQI of boththe town to cross 10 point mark. Pradipta ensured that we maintain 2Gdata speed above 120 Kbps, which is acknowledged by the customer andemployees . Pradipta guided the team to achieve top town NQI target of30 in 9 out of 10 towns in Assam and 2 out of 7 towns in NE. Pradiptaensured visiting call center to ensure proper tagging of complaintsand with continuous focus able to bring down the complaints from 9 per1000 subs to 3 per 1000 subs.Pradipta has ensured correction in worst performing cells with speed andas result improvement in cell level KPIs were visible. Pro- activemonitoring of worst cells and innovative suggestions on variousactionable helped the RF NQI not to improve significantly in Assam andNorth East in spite of increase in outages and performance impactingalarm. Pradipta has demonstrated customer obsesses ion by identifyingsites contributing to high no. of complaints and taking correctivemeasures in these sites resulting to reduction in customer complaintsw.r.t coverage, outage and KPI impacting cells. Pradipta came up withnew idea on having escalation of poor performing cells through SMS sothat immediate corrective actions are taken on cells with highdeviation in KPI threshold. Pradipta has always driven team forcontinual improvement to meet the organizational goals. Pradipta doesunderstand and respect individual preferences of each team member andmotivates accordingly so that each individual owns their responsibilityand delivers their best with minimal supervision.In spite of improvement in cell meeting KPIs and overall NQI, Silverranking could not be achieved in Assam and NE.. Hard blocking In NE washigh because of high block TRX and outages during the DBH. Hardblocking could not be maintained within 0.5% consistently in NE. RadioNQI of 25 and 22 in Assam and NE could not be achieved. Moreover toptown NQI of 30 could not be achieved in Guwahati and Silchar. NQI of 20could not be achieved in Shillong, Agartala, Dimapur, Kohima and Aizawlin NE.Assam and NE missed out in RF NQI targets and top town NQI targets INGuwahati and 5 other towns in NE where it was maintained consistently.Degradation in NQI is mainly attributed to increase in outages andperformance impacting alarm, though regular possible correction carriedout in worst performing cell. Assam missed out of Silver also due toinconsistent KPIs . Data hard blocking could not be maintained within0.5% due to cell level fluctuations and block TRX during DBH . Pradiptaneed to drive the team consistently so that the team achieves thetargeted NQI in Assam and NE including the top towns and Assam can belifted within top 10 best NQI circle.While building on good work, Pradipta needs to ensure that NQIs arefurther improved and Assam is moved into top ten in KPI ranking andcontinue cross-functional co-ordination w.r.t Quality and Complaintmanagement so that complaints per 1000 subs are further reduced anddoes not go up. Need to enhance the engagement with all the crossfunctional stake holders and be vigil on HSW compliance in the DT teamPradipta is having high aspiration and constantly working on it bystretching himself to succeed and is ready to take up additionalchallenges. Pradipta need to go through the E-Learning courses, whichwill help him develop technical as well as behavioral competencies."

With the renovation work atShillong and Bongaigaon Zones, the standard of offices has becomebetter. Concept of dry pantry at Zone/Branch has given some freshnessto the employees working out from those locations, however placingrefrizarator at those locations are still pending. Chou needs to buildgovernance model for the remote facilities. He needs to network betterespecially at remote locations and should take corrective action onproactive basis.The utilization of Guest House has increased in the current year.Support has been extended to Retail Team in searching property for newVodafone Stores by Admin Team.Chou needs to constantly review the various admin costs being paid tovendors. Have found some of the cost are higher than the market rate.HK vendor was being paid higher for long time and the benefit was notpassed to the workers.Chou needs to engage well with the employees to understand the facilityneed and should give proactive solution more often. He needs to show'can do' approach and should challenge the status quo of thefacilities. He tends to avoid challenge which can push him beyondcomfort zone. Inconsistency in Quality of food and service of existingcafeteria has caused bit unsatisfaction to the employees. Chou needs topartner with Cafeteria committee and should take the standard ofcafeteria up.IFM rolled out happened successful. Wage disbursement to HK workers ontome could have been managed better.G&A Cost analysis and the focus on travel cost has started givingbenefit. Chou should continue focus on monitoring and educating travelcost. Support to new joiners in terms of new house search, schoolinghas been extended by the Admin team. Chou needs to guide team to makethis support strong. Rationalisation of HK and Security staff by 20%from the existing facility and redeploying them to the new upcomingStores, Zone/Branch is the target of H2 which Chou should deliver forsure.Chou has supported in HSW journey as circle coordinator. He hascontributed in Water Safety initiative which has become integral partof circle safety plan. He has coordinated with Safety Spoc to collateMIS and making safety passport workable for all. Chou could havecontributed better to make effective Zonal SCM. Chou should follow theprotocol of Admin HSW and educate the team for compliance.Good to see that IFM has been rolled out, stabilized and reviews begunto get the best out of the service partner. Focus on statutorycompliance must continue. With Thomas cook empaneled as the nationaltravel service partner and 6 north circles rollout completed, lookingforward to completing this in the coming 6 months. Happy to see thatdata is accurate and sent in time which has helped analyses and sharingthe dashboards.Good to see that the zone and branch offices are being refurbished inline with the standards detailed, this I'm sure is already reflected inthe positive employee experience and feedback. Disappointed Office thatthe cafeteria has taken so long to get completed.We must continue our focus on registration of lease agreement &governance on property portfolio.

"Pankaj has overall done well on the postpaid retention portfolio andthe outbound piece including DHL. While DHL has been very consistentstory with Csats, language upgrades, 24*7 scale up, EQ, the rest ofoutbound could have been better. His overall span of control overpeople is good though needs to build more governance over the processesso as to avoid shocks over postpaid churn performance etc. has been astrong advocate of HSW and displays VF values of trust and simplicityto the core. Has good leadership qualities and an ability to operateunder stress situations.Overall an average performance wherein postpaid churn missed the target.He could have achieved this by better controls at acquisition over govtand army channels and increasing the actual market connect on gound,more visits to branches and other towns . he should learn from the fewmonths of debacle on churn performance not only to keep an eye overthe trend but also to quickly hit the problem button and seeking aquick fix. Pankaj should surely engage more in the outbound reviewswith the partner team and also improve on the connect with marketing .the overall upselling piece could have delivered far higher revenue ifthe set process of timely allocation, filteration of data and theproductivity norms be chased in scientific manner. He has to improveon the end user connect being the relations head plus bring in themomentum into relation RM portfolio. Also get more process orientedrather than launching anything without adequate working. While the VMSday and service camps were surely conducted , he had to be pushed forsame and also failed to showcase the business outcome or impact oncustomer experience owing to same. High value churn which met thetarget has been a hit but at the same time there were ampleopportunities to get to sub 1 5 levels and this can be done thru thegovernance of ZCS visits over the allocation, postpaid complaintmanagement and service delivery thru call centre/ stores. Pankaj hasgood industry knowledge as well as connect in the local market which isnot put to enough use and can been a area to exploit upon.He has been a trustworthy team member all the time. His out of the waysupport on team targets and presentation collations etc is trulyappreciated.

Well connected with his peers at ANE and other circles but atthe same time has to get involved into a cross functional highvisibility project for his next level.

"Farhad had good run on the established LOB's like prepaid activationTAT, compliance , same day activation % @ 95.The repeats also continued the low trending thru the year though anymajor leverage missed. By and large he has been able to hold on to fewprocesses which were on a healthy trendinhg as per kpi targets.The people score also improved significantly though the bottom quartilein CSG remained a concern thru the year.His contribution on HSW was steady including the ones at the activationhub. Has shown discipline and diligence in terms of his attendance .While certain LOB like complaint in prepaid showed a reduction in Feb,thru the year the same was a clear miss. Same was the case forpostpaid.Farhad's vertical failed to impress the score card targets almost thruthe entire year which impacted the circle rating big way. Given hisvintage and seniority he was expected to contribute much more instrategic terms which was a complete failutre.The circle paid penalties all 11 months on the QoS and he failed tobring in any significant improvement in that process by crossfunctional coordination.The CCCM was unstructured and his contribution in same plus the ORM wasnot at all upto the mark of the grade he carries. Against theexpectation of moving to a CS head role, the connect, delivery ,applied thinking, change adaptability was found to be very very poorto the function as well as as witnessed by the SLT.Failed to create positive moments as well as growth path for his DR'sand also was expected to tackle non performance issues for his teamwhich was a clear miss.Thru the entire year was given written and oral feedbacks on the variousslip ups but could not bounce back . also, the ability and agility toown the issues and respond the the issues was clearly found wanting.Farhad had to act like a strong back up for the functional head hasfailed to motivate his own team members or create an environment ofaspiration and people sizing for challenges.Leading a mammoth team, has little visibility to the happenings on theactivation team front, TERM coordination, nodal connect, poorsensitivity towards written com escalations and connect with theconcerned team.No applied thingking on the target setting justification for e.g on myapps and USSD revenue which continued to haunt the function throughoutthe year.Neither the application was done to target setting nor was there anyeffort to chase the given target thru improved newer means.This also happens owing to poor connect and visibility at corporatewhich lead to subsequent rejections in numerous ijp's plus the failureto influence into any of the projects.On the things which were very high intensity like TERM scores,verification process etc, had little connect or knowledge of the downline working and was not aware of the core workings and facts whereinthe team chose to keep him in isolation.The related cross function also found little value adds into his day today working which lead to his own weak governance.Thru the year the request, resolution c sats figured below bench marksciting the reasons of fibre cuts etc.Farhad has to work on bringing positivity to self and team.Is found closeted for any new ideas and activity and thus his vintageinstead of bringing in value adds is actually getting used to createblocks. He should be receptive and try a fresh approach. While toughon governance has to understand and articulate the business results andoutcomes to his team for a healthy performance.The long hours put in indicates poor time management at the same timethe response to issues is found extremely poor.Has to bring his self to the level where he is seen as a leader for histeam and this is possible by value adding to each of the process, dipstick issues basis importance and priority and be politically correct.Farhad should try for a role outside the domain for freshness to beinduced ideally.The feedbacks given on during the half year appraisal has not seen anypositive traction leading to a situation that what ever activities wereon a roll continue to be there, without any significant next levelimprovement, and those which were in red did not see any positiveupward impact like the my apps penetration, cli based complaints,, QoSscores, Wcom , complaints etc. has to try for a role which involvesless people management since this is an area he has failed to deliverand the team struggled to get their directions and dimensions right.Farhad is simple and committed to work as an individual , needs tointrospect and get his current bearings corrected may be in adifferential role / industry."

"On the key deliverables for H1, Annjuu has performed well on the SLmaintenance at prepaid and postpaid as well as TV floor. The qualityand resolution at Data floor has been exceptional and nationally bestmonth on month. Implementation of dual skill of postpaid and data is avery good initiative impacting positive CE in big way. Her connect tothe CC partner and team as well as with her downline is seamless andfound cordial. The repeats reduction too has shown positive reductionand against the score card target looks healthy which should be furtherimproved on as per internal targets. Annjuu's contribution to theconcept, set up and working of CS townhall is truly commendable. Shehas a core strength of getting along with working fraternity and showslot of interest and passion while doing so. This quality can beexploited further for self development.The SL's are prepaid were a setback for 1st quarter which has now comeback in green. Has to be more demanding to the partner over and abovenational SL's so that odd months miss of SL's either on TV, postpaid,prepaid does not happen. This is a lapse to be plugged and can be doneby articulating volumes between both the partners, giving a higherforecast for e.g on TV where there is no CPS/ cost pressure and keepingan acute eye on the HC required. There has been months where one odditem fails to deliver and impacts the CE as well as score card whichshe has to be watchful. Annjuu has to broaden her vision on the CC opsnow that she has an experienced resource on hand and needs to challengethe downline more often. The MIdesk at postpaid is a good initiativebut that also implies that there is scope for lot more which is notgetting tabled. ANE CC being the only lifeline for customers owing tolimited no of stores, there is a big time need and opportunity toimprove CE at CC. the quality scores barring few months has beenhealthy and there is more collaboration required with T&Q verticals towork upon on getting best in the country as well as increased FCR andthat shall also reduce the repeats. Annjuu is a good team member andholds on to her point of view. She also balances the seniorsexpectations versus the partner equation well. Has managed thetransition period without a resource well without major hiccup intooperations. Has good cordial connect with her vertical at corporate butthis needs to turn to great.The revenue aspect has been a big time miss. Not enough attention,devotion on same. Excess dependency on marketing. Taking six months tomodify incentive plan itself is a sad story. The planning is not uptothe mark, clarity on targets, roll out of R&R and excitement etc isall missing. This is a big visible area of opportunity and circle CSscorecard is impacted 7 months owing to this. There is a need forimmediate improvement on same. Last week of month should go into excelsheet planning and a separate tracker with weekly conf call should beput in place. The pitch and conversion details along with the yieldwhich has been taught is not followed which is the need of the day.This vertical can contribute significant to circle GSR if the act iscorrected. Too many problems and dependancies on marketing etc thrownbut she refuses to comprehend that its only HER core kpi's gettingstrangled. Overall Annjuu has too many dependancies for data,implementation of ideas etc which she could work overtime and correctit. This is slowing her down and increasing mental botheration. Thespeed element really needs to be worked upon along with clarity incommunication with seniors, peers needs to leverage between bothpartners more often basis our need and their delivery which shall giveconfidence of basic SL maintenance. Though reduction in repeats, thereis apathy to drive the CPS or repeats projects basis the CLI formulae.The strategizing was done well but implementation is very poor. Need torigourousely drive any of these projects which shall not only help thecore kpi but the success shall give visibility at national levels andhelp for lateral or vertical growth outside ANE. Annjuu is poor inshowcasing and thus is also not innovation hungry. Needs to understandthat maintenance job alone cannot suffice. The waste call at the CC isa huge wasteful expense for ANE and needs to be worked upon immediatelywherein there is a certain sluggishness as well as skewing towards thepartner.Way forward, has to be updated and future fit for HECC, make up for thelost revenue target, dedicate into a project wholeheartedly, preparefor handling the overall CE vertical. Has to get SMART in her workinghandling multi tasks with speed or else she will always keep crumblingunder the pressure of too many demands. An external workshop on samecan be facilitated. Something that is missed is applied thingking &innovation hungry which is the need of the future. Has to ensure thatcore kpi's never gets missed owing to any reason which keeps happeningon postpaid etc once in a while. Has to learn more analytics. Poor atsubmission of ideas since is not able to support with data. Needs tolearn more and more numbers. The R&R which has died premature owing tonon flashing of timely data in relevant form is one more miss and ifrevived in right manner can be instrumental in getting the targets onrevenue and repeat done."

"Nandita had an enterprising H2 and an overall very good year as far asher performances on the training and than the newer SPM roles goes.Has been found intelligent, diligent, of string governance, effectivepeople and time manager , versatile and hugry for growth as well as ona pedestal for next level challenges and uplift on any improvement areathrown upon. The m Friday activities, investment and delivery intopostpaid refreshers thru the year, fastest RED deployment in country,Vsearch hits being top in the country, push over the importance ofdecision tree, A 1 rejections refreshers yielding to 36 % reduction etcare some of the key initiatives and activities driven by her which hasbought in significant contribution either to the circle GSR, revenue orthe customer experience as measured in Csats and EQ for retails as wellas CC. the big time drive on CPS on joining the vertical immediatelyand bringing it close to DB on YTD basis a a major contribution towardscost saving as well as a LOB which had been bleeding for long. Thequick adaptability to the new role and still double hatting the thetraining fuinction is truly appreciated and demonstrates the values ofspeed as well as change. Has been able to contribute to above measuresthru good application of mind, practivcal approach and keeping thecustomer first agenda at core. Is mature and quick to understand thecircle goal , changes in priorities and thus has been able to showcaseherself ahead of others. The communication and presentation skills hasimproved immensely thru the year thru practice,, research andshamelessly adapting the industry or circle best practices. Is vocal, aquality she should pursue, has independent point of view and is soughafter by cross functions owing to her skills of being simple and crispas well aas her cerebral capabilities. Can handle multi tasks and is asignificant Vf family member for all people engagement events andactivities as well as a strong VIN member. Lead the new canteenproject from the front which would not have materialsed without herpresence. Contribution to the m pesa has also been worth for the scorecard to be at no 3. Is able to articulate well and is a good leaderwho works closely with performers. Has to take care of her habit ofgetting in isolation in case of non performers, non reactives withinteam or cross functions. Could see herself making inroads in aprogressive way on the cross functional collaboration as well as makingpositive presence felt with SLT.On the new role the 121 pitching and conversion is a miss. This can beimproved by having a structured monthly operating plan along withmarketing , deep dive into the chordiant loading, product details,ticket size and influencing partner to invest. The challenge of revenuesharing has to be showcased to SLT and convince on the viability ofrevenue sharing and the benefits of a higher revenue footage to VF inturn. There was little intervention on shaky post paid retention atground level in terms of training plus a qualitative initiative on thepost paid floor which should be capitalized now in the coming year.Out bound also has not been given due weitage and importance in thetraining era and thus in the new role and way forward wherein itbecomes part of her own vertical, has to ensure a deep dive, partnerconnect and put the process on a sustained acceleration mode. Theoutbound without DHL has been a doggy process and there is an amplescope which she should capitalize upon by investing in right manpowerto lead, deciding on right partnership and inspire a Customer Firstagenda into the Cs process of OB and value proposition based upsellingfor the S&M based process. The digitalization did not see much lightbut given the conceptual vision shared by her on same, furtherinvestment and contribution is a must even though not heading the coretraining function. Should take this as an project which shall also givethe SLT and corporate a confidence on her potential abilities for afuturistic leadership role. Can do that immediately starting withdigitalized learning centres @ A2 via web cam etc. the urban versusrural training mode is another area which can be clubbed.Nandita has the potential for growth and taking more challenges. She hasto set up a dead line on her direction and chase it along with thesupport of the RM. Her constraint over mobility if flexible shall onlyaccelerate the growth process. Has to take care of not making herdislikes for non performing partners, people too apparent and shouldkeep herself engaged with that segment. While she is crisp and smartin the operating way, as she grows has to adapt more maturity on theend results like the overall efficacy of a process for eg ""fastestdeployment of m pesa/ RED plan """" by applying herself on the ultimatequality of delivery by the frontline and the output by and large hasto adapt the larger cause in the longer run and not get satisfied norshowcase the short team victory. Has great qualities of an able leaderand a thought provoking individual. Some investment into good readinghas to materalise along with the self investment in "" Fish! "" trainingmethodology correlating to the potential to be an trainingentrepreneur."

"APD comment:Overall: arun, the efforts and travel you have done in the zone acrossall geographies is well appreciated. as a zone, at competitive level,the zone faired well and gained grounds. in places like meghalaya andMizoram, you have played a good role and helped team rejig thedistribution by changing nearly 70% of all distributors with new ones.Arun, however, there were so many fundamental things that was wrong,The channel correction and consolidation was done quiet well inMizoram, Meghalaya, even Barak valley: Nagaland and Manipur is the maincause of problem and you never did do much of correction there.. addthis to the fact that new investments went to Manipur and Nagaland inlarge measure, we fell short tremendously. there was a specific agendaagreed upon for driving this year between S&M head, ZH and you.. thatis you will extensively drive New investments and LUT, we could havedone a lot better with new investments, some pockets in our zone stillsuffer and fundamentally not stable still. The correction is 30% ofwhat could have been done and some clusters needs a lot more drive.What & how on ""Hits and misses""Goal 1Data tertiary has been good with revenue growing well and now sitting at12.9% to total tertiary.. a good feat. The DSO count of 9.4K is alsohealthy and 67% of all etop are DSO.. with this, there is a need topush further to 80% this year. We however have only 3.7K 3G DSOoutlets which is a big miss as 3G revenue still less than 50l/month nowand tapering growth. At a competitive level, with the correction donealso, the zone gained on RMS and gained well.. however should havegained a lot more.Goal2:CMS continues to hover at 21% and even over the year, while we gainedwell in some markets, Manipur & Nagaland was stressed with not muchgrowth, primarily this happened as we are bogged down with distributioncorrection in these two states. This created a lot of resistance in ourRES plan and we continued to be under stress.Goal3:As said, UEO is healthy growing and I can see a lot of correction in thegrass root level on this front, UAO is the concern area thru out andmonth on month dropped. This led to huge pressure on quality and forthe year, never crossed the 80% T3M level which was so required as azone.the tasking was not indept with proper guidance but an ask fornumbers, many CSMs started playing gross game on fewer outlets and theactual market working dwindled. regulatory issues hit us.Project Nipurn was a success from your personal front, and I had hopedthat the learnings from this could have done better for you and helpedus in ICR and new investments, you somehow could never improve on thisand whatever we could have gained was nullified.Goal 4:In Mpesa, we had major problems in the beginning and started catching uplately. As per target, achieved the number for revenue butcompetitively but far short than other zones. agents decay is more andthe team at grass root level were never really aligned to the agenda ofrunning this business cleanly with better quality agents selection andrigor thereafter. This led to slow pick up of business and with lowercustomer base using it, the kink which is needed to propel thisbusiness is reduced immensely.Goal 5:HSW is a key area where as a zone, you have driven well and your teamhas been instrumental under your leadership in this aspect.Innovation in doing work and finding new ways of driving business eitherthru communication or though leardership is lacking.Grooming of employees in the system through knowledge sharing is weak inthe past 1 year.progress on development: Arun, computer skills is learnt by trying outon your own, SOme basis books on MS office is available in allbookstores for use.. would request you to put a lot more effort inlearning this as it will aid you a lot more. while your colleagueswill help, but initiative on this is from your side.. it is critical tolearn some.progress on career aspiration: Arun, to grow henceforth needs initiationfrom you end and not dependency on orders or suggestion from top.. itis a senior role you hold and you should allign to the objective of theorganisation, a leadership approach to doing work is required andshould take responsibility on your shoulder. there has been little ondeveloping your self, the meeting we had with HR and S&M head in July2014 had a specific role and expectation mapped out which saw not muchprogress and you need to work on that first."

""Dandwaat Pranam"": ""Kya hona hai"" ""Fayda kya hai"" .""Hota tokuchh hai nahi"" etc.2) When advised to plug the gap in Tx planning in one of the BSC outageincident, revert as"" YOU Too"" and "" Have control over operationpart"" .. A purely Non Professional and negative approach as a DR andthat too by a senior planning manager. (Rewa BSC outage incident-date:- May 22, 2014) .3) Direct complaint of subordinates in writing rather than coachingthem, even after the matter was already discussed.4) Raised concern in open house with BH that appropriate opportunitiesnot facilitated to groom horizontal in other fields and wished to moveto opening with VBS sales , It was a negative approach to raise suchconcern in open house and declined when opportunity was awarded by BHhimself in consultation with HR, Such action spread negative spiritamongst other junior colleagues present in open house.Engage: Poor coordination with Peers and team in field team- Failedin Resolving conflicts amicably, with minimal involvement from seniors,keeping the overall business benefit in mind.Example:-1) Lack of Involvement in Jalablpur Tikona Outage(08/12/14).

Whenasked ,why it was not escalated to Tx Head/CTO, reason given ""My phonewas faulty"".2) Without proper outage analysis, she acknowledged concern of VBSoutage in front of BH - Shows Lack of Analytical skills or wish !!!3) Lacking initiative in planning related to coordination with fieldand TNOC, example- E1 provision in new site rollout with path chokecases, etc.4) Delayed response of Email communication- e.g. Regular escalationsfrom IT and retail functions.5) Regular /multiple followups required for update- e.g. Raiatel Mediafeasibility, Guest House link provisioning, New Store Link provisioningetc.Lack of Ownership- Didn't demonstrate ownership, always tries to giveexcuse about team's limitations rather than coaching them .1) Never Deep Diving at Micro Level of the situation.2) Poor coordination with BSS field team, always escalates as- ""It willbe escalated .To phir order jaane dete hai aap dekh lo""3) Mansarovar LNCT UBR shifting case- Directly ask for CTO interventionto coordinate with Idea without any self effort.4) Close Loop - most of the times, she fails to concludes, withagreement of all stakeholders involved.5) Didn't demonstrate Sense of urgency/Proactive approach- Kamla nagarequipment shifting is not followed up properly. FLDS design team notapproached in Six months after first mail, when it was known thatcurrent site have critical infra issue and a serious Threat to VBSservices in entire Indore city.When asked about it, replied"" Mail kar diya tha .abhi phir se mail kardeti hun""6) BW constraint not analysed proactively and relative capacity planningnot done.7) Constraint in VBS deliveries were not appraised to line manager orCTO, it came to notice only through escalations in VC with central teamor circle sales team. E.g. Mux unavailability, solution pending cases,final customer acceptance pending cases etc.8) It was advised , Mux ordering should have drafted plan with signoffin advance but not prepared before ordering. 28 number of Huawei Muxordered without any drafted plan-8 nos of STM-64 Mux ordered withdrafted plan signoff ( Discussed on Date:16/2/2015 in weekly TLTmeeting)Leadership Skill : Poor Leadership and lack of team management1.

Habitual late comer, mostly comes office after 09:45 am even afterrepeated reminders.Set a poor example for the team.3. Team is highly demotivated and completely out of sync with her,written complaint from both sides.Concern raised by multiple team members.Specific Focus on Way Forward:>She should develop her working style in the way that she can beconsistently relied on to deliver in terms of on-time and qualityoutput on the deliverables assigned.>She need to Build Trust within her own team as well as Peer Teammembers.>She needs improvement in Demonstrating positive attitude.>She need to start taking complete ownership, finds solutions toobstacles at own initiative rather than getting bogged down by them.>She need to improve team bonding, Should motivates team towards thegoal in tough conditions. That will help her to improve her MI score.>She should Go an extra mile to accomplish results, rather giving up atstart and just start escalating things .> She need to learn closure of the loop - most of the times, she failsto concludes, with agreement of all stakeholders involved.>She should improve in Grasping new concepts pertaining to own subjectarea quickly, e.g. Handling IP solutions in VBS and analysis ofissues/problem reported to IP/MPLS/FLDS.>She is lacking in Demonstrating openness to taking on new challenges byaccepting new responsibilities and or new ways of working e.g. She hasshown willing to move VBS sales and then declined to accept the change.>She need to Learns from past mistakes and does notrepeat them >She need to improve in Reacting to newsituations with maturity - She need to Learn how to demonstrateresponsiveness and calm approach to such new situations>She needs to be calm and effective even when under pressure fordeliveries or tighttimelines.>She need to improve in Resolving conflicts amicably, with minimalinvolvement from seniors, keepingthe overall business benefit in mind>She needs to improve in Listening to others for better understanding'sdevelopment and growth.Progress on Development Goals:Most critical improvement required is change in her Behaviour -Negativeattitude to Positive. No significant improvement observed inspite ofintense coaching time to time and during MYPD by Line Manager and CTO.From approach & working style, would like Shalini to get involved deeplyin planning & deep analysis for creating sustainable differentiation.She should be proactive & consistent.Progress on Career Aspirations:Avoiding mood swings in interactions with Colleagues in her team ,peers, field team and senior colleagues as well as in cross functionalforums is a key requirement to enhance personal effectiveness for nextfunctional position..She need to improve her acceptability in field team as she aspirant togrow as Transport Head position and same was advised during MYPD alsobut No Significant improvement as per the input from the field teams."

"Element of Appreciation:Very Kind Hearted Monika is hard working, sincere and honest. She inspite of having challenge of OE alignment with additionalresponsibility of huge coverage to be done on Mpesa, she did good job.She is very caring in nature for her team, compare to last year she haschanged herself a lot and focus on brilliant basics have fallen inplace now within training team. She has taken punt to release best ofher resources for their growth and need of the organization.Hits versus the Target on ""What"":In order to bring newness in the training and doing different fromroutine also linked to business out put, various initiatives likeProject Navodaya, Project Zero Defect, C-Sat ka shahensha, outboundpremier league , Project bingo, Project at your service, Data zoneCreation etc were done. Such initiatives helped to improve the scoresin training score card, quality and c-sat for 0-30 agents, taggingaccuracy, reductions in repeat and there for FCR at retail and callcenters. Training for Mpesa roll out, for VF Red plan roll out hasbeen a good success story.Misses versus the Target on ""What"":National ranking on score card has been clear miss. The factor ofconsistency in performance is required. Some of the national bestpractice needs to be created. Some of the project time lines wereimpacted some time. People scores needs to be focused that havedipped. Training Need identification and efficacy of training givenbased on TNI were not clearly made visible. Retail Service scores wereimpacted.Hits on ""How"" aspect:Monika has good inter department coordination, especially with Retail.She takes proactive action on planning and keeps driving otherfunctions to make the best of use of training team for capabilitybuilding, she goes out of the way to accommodate every ones'convenience. Her coordination with corp too is pretty good. Rescentpat she has aligned training and has started driving them towardscommon objectives of business.Misses on ""How"" aspect:Monika now needs to put thinking hat on and start taking strategicinitiatives. People aspect needs to be the key focus area, need to haveclear balance between people and performance. While applied thinkingpart has been seen to an extent, the aspects of Engage and Drivestill needs to be seen. Certain discipline of meeting time lines ofproviding details to function head, governance mechanism, takingownership while things are not going good needs to be looked at andensuredSpecific Focus on Way Forward:Training content development and deployment now needs to be looked atfrom customer needs based training need identification. Driving bestof the results through people needs to be built in as DNA. Rather thanbeing defensive, start looking at bigger picture from customer, partnerand organization perspective. The hunger to be the best in countryneeds to be seen.APD:Element of Appreciation:Monika in training vertical has done huge improvement from where MPCGwas to where we are today. Monika is kind hearted, caring in nature andalways ready with yes attitude for taking up more activities. Thenational ranking of MPCG coming in to top 3 ranks says a lot abouteverything within training that she has done along with her team. Shetakes feedback positively and works on it on immediate basis.WHAT:Hits versus the Target on ""What"":The best thing that has happened last year in training is that the teamhas become customer centric, business centric and not just being KBIfocused. They really moved from Training Need Identification toCustomer Need Identification. From just being routine they startedlinking their efforts to business output, various initiatives likeProject Navodaya, Project Zero Defect, C-Sat ka shahensha, outboundpremier league , Project bingo, Project at your service, Data zoneCreation etc were done. Such initiatives helped to improve the scoresin training score card, quality and c-sat for 0-30 agents, taggingaccuracy, reductions in repeat and there for FCR at retail and callcenters. Training for Mpesa roll out, for VF Red plan , iphone roll outhas been a good success story. One of the biggest successes is ofgetting MPCG 3 members as national service champs.Misses versus the Target on ""What"":While we reached top 3 ranking as we are about to exit the year samerigor should have been there from day one . Consistency of performance,business partnering with other vertical and eye on exception shouldhave been there. For eg MNP is big struggle area, but did not seefocus on the same from training perspective, training of AOs andtraining drive on HSW is still not visible.HOW:Hits on ""How"" aspect:Monika, being kind hearted and accommodative, is very popular assupportive vertical head. Her interpersonal skills and team connectespecially with retail is pretty good. Deals with corp team very welland supports driving national agenda. Not having shortcut kind ofapproach we never got any negative remarks on process etc in training.Misses on ""How"" aspect:Monika, could have built internal score cared for her team to drivenational score card and to get the best out of team, which was not donein spite of multiple instructions/direction. If this would have beendone probably we could have reached top 3 ranking much earlier.Balancing people and performance is something that needs to be focusedup on. VPS is areas of focus. Eye on exception on business outputcould have been better.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Internal cross vertical alignments with major focus to convert retailstouch points as service touch points than just being sales touch pointneeds to be driven aggressively. Deployment and expansion of traininginfra for training reach is must area to be closed within next onemonth. Training content development and deployment now needs to belooked at from customer needs based training need identification.Driving best of the results through people needs to be built in as DNA.The hunger to be the best in country needs to be continued."

He has started the facility helpdesk andthe Cafeteria Committee. He has ensured regular tracking of expenses aswell as correct booking of expenses. IFM has been rolled out at theCircle. Ramana has also taken initiative to register the Sagar Branchoffice. The guest house has been revamped and is one of the bestfacilities. Successful completion of HSW audit and training of driverson defensive Driving.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Timely and within budget completion of Gwalior office has been a miss.Roll out of new offices at Jabalpur, Guna, and Bilaspur is a miss andthe MSC property has not been finalised as yet. Though Store propertieswere identified however, there has been a delay because of issues oflack of proper documentation/ legal clearances. Leveraging of theFacilities helpdesk for identification and timely resolution of issues.Effective utilisation of the Cafeteria Committee. Registration ofIndore AB road store.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Ramana is good at identifying opportunities to positively impact teamdeliverables and explores alternatives if something is not working out.He keeps his cool under pressure situations.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Lack of proactive/effective communication because of which there is lackof awareness of what the team delivers. Engaging relevant stakeholdersin a timely way/ escalating issues before we hit roadblocks. Keepingbusiness requirements in mind while recommending options which willensure timely closures. Effective delegation to team and raising theperformance delivery.Specific Focus on Way Forward:It is important for Ramana to raise the performance bar of the team,drive greater customer centricity and speed in execution, as well asensure timely execution of key projects. There is a huge requirement tobring in focus and rigour on HSW in the Circle and Ramana as the HSWspoc needs to spearhead this. Managing costs effectively is going to beanother focus area for the year ahead and he needs to review/monitorand recommend actions to handle this effectively.Ramana also needs to focus on developing his team members.Inputs from SuzanneRamana has rolled out IFM, he must now demand improved servicestandards. He has contributed to the security project and sharedlearnings that has helped design better procedures, he is also workingon the shortlisting of the RFP security partners. His reports areaccurate and most often reach well in time. Ramana is always willing toshare best practices and gives feedback on issues whenever requested.Looking forward to the other zone / branch offices becoming operationalover the next few months. Disappointed to see that the zone spoc's arenot yet a part of the IFM structure, it must be completed in April.Ramana must focus on his leadership skills, delegate so his team cangrow into bigger roles. Looking forward to rolling out the nationalservice partners for Guest House in April and once finalized theservice partners for travel and security management with HCrationalization during the coming months.With the focus on cost efficiencies this year would definitely wantRamana to focus on reducing the G&A costs - facilities, security,utilities & travel sharing best practices and looking for opportunitiesto bring down the cost.All the best Ramana for the year ahead"

There is a need toalso focus on understanding gaps related to acquisition churn andcontributing towards reducing the same .Overall Rajesh has performed quite well and he continues being focusedin his drive levels..

Has been influential inlaunching Puthu Chennai priorities and has been contributing towardsbuilding chennai north distribution business. Has faced couple ofchallenges on Distribution infra and CSM manpower attrition. With thecurrent Team Size of 3 ASMs and 13 CSMs I am sure kesav will turnaround the expectations from Puthu Chennai and prepaid business. Thisis coupled with his core strength of operational excellence and I amconfident about chennai north zone reaching higher levels ofperformance during mar 15 and q1 2015.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Has achieved 100% of the net gross DB target for the full year 2014-15.Has achieved the MNP DB target with 107% .

He has now strengthened with topperforming ASMs of TN to support in driving Chennai North Distributionof prepaid business. I am sure the team and kesav are very confident intaking the chennai prepaid business to the desired level from mar 15onwards.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Kesav has not been able to achieve many of the Distribution MetricTargets. This has been a greater challenge and this has pulled back themomentum of distribution.

"Key achievements include High roll outs, New Stores, clearance of oldgood in the warehouse. Very High scores in VPS, and diversity from 0to 30%.All this he was able to do with strong drive for execution and to meettargets and deadlines. This he was also able to do because of the fact,he has been in this role for > 5 years, which gives him the confidenceand experienceHowever, on people development, he is yet to develop his No 2 person inthe SCM organisation, and personally he does not intend to take uplarger roles, which leaves the team stranded and stuck. This may notbe an healthy sign for the team.While on execution, Ravi is seen as a strong leader, however Ravi needsto give Strategic inputs to his team and peer members in the group,Coach and Develop the team, and aggressively participate in CrossFunctional discussions. This would have helped the teams to runefficiently by saving costs and also on reducing inventory atwarehouse, which closed better in H2, but not so well in H1.Ravi needs to grow in his career, and should start demonstrating, bygiving strategic inputs, analytical inputs, alternatives and alsoparticipate in some of the discussions not related to his function. Healso needs to deep dive and understand some of the cost structures likeIndus, CS, CNC etc. He should also be in a position to demonstrate asa leader to his team members, so that his team can be developed to headSCM in other circles and corporate. Lack of such display would bedetrimental to the progress of his team members.Overall, he has spent more than adequate time in the current role, andshould look at making a lateral move or to a different assignmentasap."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last one year...You has moved from the Circle role into the Zone in January 2014 andpost your movement one of the observations relate to the bringing in alot of positivity and improving the overall morale of the team. Youare a team player who stands by his team and supports them in all theirefforts and this is quite an appreciative leadership trait observed.Overall DB has been achieved (1.90%) against a target of 2.13% with amiss out of one month in April 2014. Data pack upsell has been a verygood story with a contribution of 7624 in this financial year. Somenotable and unique engagement programs has been driven by you inalignment to Data positioning, specific bpo segments , My vodafone App, mpesa etc have shown some positive impact in terms of referral saleand data upsell. Ravi has also won the Titans award for Q1 and hasbeen the cs scorecard topper in the month of May. Retail engagement hasshown good improvement in terms of reduction in p2p numbers and Ravideserves the credit for having strengthened the engagement.Areas Of Improvement /FocusVoluntary Churn has continued being a concern with an achievement of oneout of 6 months. FOS per day productivity is yet another areas whereYou are yet to start showing the required progress. You should startfocusing on this on a very serious note lest the dependency on the mothend reactivations continue. There is a need to justify the field forceproductivity considering the sheer number of field force existing inthe system. Quality of reactivations is a huge concern and it stands at55% as against a target of 70%. PG churn stands at 1.09% as against atarget of 0.75%. Greater than 750 churn stands at 2.07% as against1.5%. Non usage which was a concern last year had shown a downtrend inJune, July (3.55%), however it has spiked up again in Aug and Sep(4.28%) which is much higher than the circle average. Complaints onwrong reactivations continue to hound the Zone and there is a need tomake the required changes and have a zero tolerance policy with teammembers who continue to create this situation.You should focus on improving your drive levels with teams and shouldset expectations very clearly. Considering the base you handle and therigor which should be build-in, you should contemplate on this area ofimprovement on a serious note. Waiver management is an area where youneed to focus. You can definitely work on proactive approach on teamproductivity rather than adopting a reactive approachTo summarize Being a senior MCS overseeing customer service for TN'slargest zone, there's more that you can bring to the table. You need towiden your sphere of influence in the zone and engage more intensivelyto take a 360 degree view. Given the deep linkages of retail withcustomer experience, you need to develop a sharp understanding ofpatterns at CHN south zone's stores and focus on driving EQ & TNPSmore. Given that TNPS is considered an authentic barometer of CE, youcertainly need to play a more active role and shape CE proactively,through smart & well targeted interventions in conjunction with theRetail Lead and Circle team. On Churn, you need to get into RCA morethan focusing on KPIs alone - you need to develop a clear view ondifferent churn drivers for Consumer & Enterprise and develop acalibrated approach to churn management, than a 'one size fits all'approach. You need to play a more vigilant role on shaping acquisitionquality at the zone, more so given CHN South's size. Your interfacewith Activation Officers on various matters has to continue and youdefinitely need to drive HSW for this community and be a torchbearer.One would expect you to generate more ideas and new interventions todrive performance improvement. Compliance is an aspect that needs to beon your radar, as growth scales up in H2.You need to be a step up and be seen as 'first among equals' among allMCS in TN and take the zone to being the best zone in CS during H2...All the best for a great H2...Ravindran - APD 2014/15Overall Appreciation for performance in last 6 months:You have done some excellent work in the CS area in taking the zone tobeing the Titan Winners in Q1, Runners in Q2 .

"You had a reasonably good first half wherein malappuram did well onInfra targets, Tertiary growth has been the best in the circle YoY,Malappuram led the way on many initiatives like HH and has showntremendous progress on AVI scores in the last 6 months. The team in thebranch was driven with focus on discipline and fundamentals and the onemajor miss has been in us losing our GAS / CMS % to idea and the soonerwe fix it with all the manpower now in place, the better for us in H2as malappuram's progress is critical to circle's fortunes and it's timeto deliver our promise of getting Vodafone lead over idea on CMS in thedistrict. While prepaid nos have shown growth from our exclusive touchpoints, postpaid stagnancy and at times degrowth has been a concernalways especially from stores and it's time we stopped discussing thesame and fix it forever. Mpesa as a new initiative remains a concernwherein the branch has not been a front runner and as discussed this issomething we expect from your branch. Urge you to work on the pointswhich will make a difference to the fortunes of the branch and thuscontributes to the circle's fortunes. Please continue to work with allthe intensity but at the same time ensure we have a control on the highattrition which has troubled us in the near future.==========================================================Final Review comments :You had a good first half in malappuram wherein Malappuram grew well onInfra & Revenue parameters. It was good to see the effort done to plugthe distribution gaps and also you helping the new team members inevery stream settle in asap which shows great amount of leadershipskills from you. Credit to your commitment and ownership, the rolechange came in and as deserved you are handling the largest zone in theform of Calicut and I am sure the same passion and commitment from youwill take Calicut to greater glory in days to come.Hits vs Target on what aspect of performance1) Malappuram had the highest Revenue YoY growth in the circle2) Malappuram was the only Branch to achieve Infra norms in the circle3) Calicut zone being runner up in Region star for Q2 and awarded thebest Mpesa zone on Q34) Zone being the best in the circle on new initiatives - HH / Mpesa5) Zone was the best on activation quality and T2M / T3M and the way itwas close monitored helped.6) Great work on expanding distributors across the zone considering thechallenge we have there.7) Consistently in the Top 3 in the circle on CS score card and C&Cparameters8) VPS score was the best in the last 3 - 4 yearsMisses vs Target on what aspect of performance1) DB target missed on UAO across the zone2) MNP nos started crashing down from a once superior level3) Idea's gain in Calicut & Malappuram and our inability to arrest thetrend4) Retail business not scaling up inspite of new roll outs of stores andnew team members coming in5) Targets missed on new VMS roll outs6) Attrition of team members was a grave concern across streamsHits on how aspect of performance1) Rigor of discipline helped in looking at finer details and helpingthe team drive the same2) Consistent Channel engagement programs through the Grand Mastercontests for distributors & vms partners3) Strict Governance helped - Weekly PBC / Team meetings / Networkmeetings4) Regular stock monitoring and right sizing of distributors at theright time helped in revenue growth5) Back to Basics helped on Mpesa across the zone - Doing it First timeright and not rush or fine easy routes was the objective well driven.Misses on how aspect of performance:1) Larger territories being vacant didn't help in the drive to excelagainst idea but the ownership and involvement to get the best out ofour stronger markets was missing whether it's through specificinterventions or aggressive push.2) Larger distribution partners going flat and not focusing on drivinggross to scale up.3) Retail team underperforming across the zone and not owning upcontinue to be an issue.4) The team not being driven according to the size of industry reallyhit the overall business. It's time to look at external positions tooto drive key objectives especially in our strong markets in the zone.Specific focus on Way ForwardYou have very hands on approach towards operation and that definitelyhas served you well in leading your team and overcoming whateverchallenges in a tough territory as malappuram.

"Priya has rolled out the new incentive program for the CRE's along withthe revised TOT for Channel partners during the last year. Specificrigour on low earning CRE's as well as low earning Channel partners hasbeen a miss during the last year. Channel partner meets have not beenconsistent during the year. Few things have resulted into multiplefollowups but those tasks continue to be unfinished as of now. As perthe MYPD discussion, following were the key things which were to bedone and had to be taken forward. The status on each one of them is asfollows :-""Following are the 5 key things that Priya needs to deliver on during H2:-1) ""Postpaid to hit the aspirational number. Acquisition Churn needs tobe brought within control. The focus has to be for getting theproductivity to higher levels specifically on Stores. RED has to be asignificant contributor with 30% of postpaid acquisitions."" Postpaidachievement is done against the DB number. Productivity for Stores hasbeen dipping in tthe second half of the year. There has been slightimprovement in the RED achievement.2) ""DATA business with 65%+ attach rate has to be driven well. 3Gdongles on postpaid is another key business which needs a bettercontribution from Retail."" Data attach rate achievement has beeninconsistent. The gaps have been on the governance around this withspecifics on training and handholding to the frontline. Also, theVodafone Star program did not take off during the year.3) ""M-pesa productivity - monthly 4000."" Mpesa is at 2500 levels againstthe planned numbers. The achievement has been inconsistent month onmonth. Incentivization for Mpesa has given some fillip during the yearbut has not taken off from there. The CRE pitching at frontline forMpesa continues to be a concern.4) ""Store profitability - all the new Global Stores have to starthitting the expected productivity as per the phasing plan. She needs tospend time on the monthly profitability. 70% of the Vodafone Storesneed to be profitable by the end of this year."" The catchment activityto be done around the Global Stores has not happened as per the plan.The activities were very random and were not stitched well during theyear.

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 9 months: Pranab has been agreat asset for us. These first 9 months have been a great start forPranab in Vodafone. What stands out in terms of performance, is thesense of ownership that Pranab has taken towards the MPLS portfolio. Hefocuses on the end to end experience of customers - both internal andexternal and has a big picture in mind in taking decisions or workingon projects. The manner in which he owned up to managing NPLC pricingwith TRAI recommendations in spite of the product not in his portfoliowas highly commendable.Pranab is technically sound and understands the market and customerdemands well. He does not take things at face value and is prepared tochallenge the status quo to work on beneficial solutions, the waythings are done. The passion with which he worked on the timelycompletion of CRM/ AMDOCS Testing; the discussions on scoping/workarounds done with IT reflect his maturity, resilience and ownershipto the task. It has been a delight working with Pranab and we shouldinvest more in his overall development.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance: ] We are well on courseto achieve the MPLS revenue target. Pranab has been supporting thesales, solutions and commercial teams on multiple strategicopportunities. Post the TRAI revisions in NPLC prices, the first cutrecommendations made on new prices were challenged by Pranab and he setout to rework on the logic. He questioned some of the assumptions,worked on getting competitive information and through a new set ofrecommendations (which we implemented), helped us save 7.5mn revenue inFY 14-15, besides much more savings in times to come. In fact, he hasbeen more than willing to take on responsibilities beyond his productdomain, examples being the fine work he put in creating the new DoAtool and scoping for revised CRM Quote module for the overall FLDcategory.In terms of new products, the primary contribution has been on the CRM/AMDOCS project. We had to complete the UAT and Business Simulation ofthe new CRM and AMDOCS billing systems in tight timelines. Pranabworked really long hours as well as over multiple weekends and tookcritical decisions with the IT team to ensure this task was completedin a timely manner and enabled timely launch of the systems. He workedwith the regulatory and NPD team to get clarity on the VSAT project.The quality of product documentation has been upto the mark, clearlyarticulating customer requirements, product specifications andassociated technical requirements.Pranab's work has been appreciated by multiple colleagues and some ofthe cross functional projects he has been working on such as RAPID andIPVPN Harmonization have seen key contributions from his end.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance: Due to contract issueswith Hughes, we missed the VSAT launch timeline. Also the launch of DoAtool got delayed due to higher priority assigned to other projects. TheIPVPN Harmonization track which has a high group dependency has notbeen progressing well. We are now working on this independently as wellwhere Pranab has provided key inputs.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours): The focuson customer experience and processes is evident in the challenges thatPranab throws on all colleagues questioning the status quo. He isalways seeking improvements and striving towards perfection. This is aperfect recipe to foster innovation. Pranab ensures he takes alongcolleagues in all projects and developments that he drives and thequality of these interactions has been very satisfying. Pranab uses histechnical prowess well and the fact that he is conscious of customerrequirements is testified by the manner he approaches non standardrequirements from a technical and commercial perspective. He follows uprigorously on timelines, escalates when required and provides timelysupport to others when needed showing the drive to succeed. Pranabembodies the Vodafone way of working on all fronts and can be a goodrole model for others.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours): Pranabticks off almost all boxes on multiple fronts as far as Vodafone WayBehaviours are concerned. One tricky position he often finds himself isthat in his quest for perfection, there have been instances when speedhas been sacrificed resulting in delay in delivery.Specific Focus on Way Forward: As highlighted earlier, Pranab is anasset for the organization and we should invest in his development. Hewill need some coaching to be able to prioritize work in amulti-tasking environment which I am confident he will adapt to withease. He needs to start doing more circle visits to ensure he is alwaysglued on to the pulse of the market and customer."

He has beenmanaging two critical Projects , very methodical in his work , goodat Customer management and also very positive with cross functionalTeams. He did also stretch to take a third Project on board whichwas having poor customer experience and has turned it around to bringthings under control. He is definitely a dependable and good resourceto the Team. to have done all this in a span of first 6 months isappreciable."
"Kashish joined Vodafone in October 2014 and has been part of the VGE FLDcommercial team for the last 6 months. He quickly picked up things andstarted contributing to the team from his first week itself. Hiscontribution in supporting the sales team in winning deals incommendable. He has been inducted into Vodafone and now understands allthe stakeholders, Org structure, processes, Products, tools andsystems. He was instrumental in rolling out the business case templateand the revised DOA to the sales teams leading to reduced response timeto the market.In the last 6 months, Kashish has built his rapport with the product andfinance team who are the major stakeholders in his day to dayoperations. Kashish has supported the sales teams by providingcompetitive intelligence to win some of the critical orders like HCL,Wipro, Amazon etc.Kashish needs to create and maintain commercial tracker and focus oninitiatives to contain price erosion during renewals and manage churneffectively. He should attend product workshops to acquire in-depthunderstanding of the technology and network. He needs to volunteer tobe part of organization-wide projects which will give him widerexposure and enhance his learning experience. He should look atcreating differentiation in the deals through SLAs & penalties and yetmitigating risks in the deal. He should align himself more closely withthe sales teams to meet the customers often and gather marketintelligence.Kashish with his experience in the fixed line domain and ability toinfluence his peers and other stakeholders will be able to drive fixedline commercial strategies."

"Prashant has been with Vodafone for last 5 months. Most of the belownotes are from his mid probation dialogue.Overall performance summary:Prashant has a good understanding of the market, customer requirementsand competitive offerings given his pre-sales background. He needs totranslate these strengths in creating meaningful and appealing customervalue propositions. He is very receptive to feedback and acts on itwhich will help him in his formative period as a Product Manager. Hehas contributed well during the UAT for the Enterprise CRM and AMDOCSbilling system.Comments on Development Areas:Product Management is new to Prashant and he will need some handholdingto do well in the current role. He will need to bring in more speedwhich I am confident will happen with increased Product Managementexposure.Way Forward:In the next 3 months, focus has to be on Operational Intensity andcoaching circles on the conferencing portfolio. Initiatives on theconferencing portfolio have also been identified as part of the 10 BY20 Program. Another area will be to work on building the overall UCroadmap for Vodafone. The most important contribution will be indesigning the GTM strategy and plan for VONE-C which is a big bet forthe future."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Keerti's overall performance in the last 12 months has been good. Shehas lead the service team well in a challenging network environment.Though churn has been an issue she has worked well to ensure some ofthe large accounts have not churned. She is a good team leader and hasmanaged the team very well.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Overall value churn reduced from 3.73 to 2.09 %. FLD service assuranceand delivery performance is good.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Subscriber Churn 2.39% vs DB of 1.99%.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):1.Good C level engagement2. CSAT score has been good3. FLD Service assurance and delivery has been on track. All majororders have been delivered on time.She is very good a follow up and ensuring tasks are completed when tasksand she is a good delegator. Her excellent knowledge of the systemhelps with quick issue resolution.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Quality of Field interactions at 3.3 which is way below nationalaverage. ESS registration one of the lowest in the country. No ofservice desks should be increased dramatically to improve from currentlevels to improve overall service levels and customer experience.Keerti with her experience should lead one or two business impactingprojects which are cross functional in nature with agreed on businessoutcomes. She should empower her team to make more decision and helpthem groom as future leaders. She should provide more tought leadershipand emerge as a coach and mentorSpecific Focus on Way Forward:Keerti should focus on one or two business impacting projects that shecan drive personally for eg churn reduction in top 25 accounts.

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months: Ashish startedthe year with a new role in a new circle. For him, handling a team oftwenty two people in a new circle where he had never worked before wasunique experience. He however used his enormous experience gained fromhis stint in Gujarat to good effect, correcting processes and MIS'swhere ever he thought appropriate. The tracking of BD in zones wasclarified further by making changes in the MIS. Sudden increase in FLD& FLV sourcing led to incremental billings as well as a lot service &configuration issues which resulted in collection & BD getting effectedin these portfolio's. Ashish undertook a detailed follow up of eachoutstanding case with the C&C team and then with the VBS sales &service team to untangle the web of issues and managed to clear to alarge extent the problems which were there. He has also aggressivelyfollowed up on the Feedback on SMS functionality which is now anational best practice.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance: AP cash collections at99.27% is above the target of 98.75%. FLV cash collections at 97.1%though below the 100% collection target is still the best in thecountry. FLD BD at .9% is better than the target of 1% and due to theoverall collection & BD effort, the circle was consistently ranked 3rdin the C&C ranking for the year. Despite having close to 350 FOS on theground, the collection function is on top of the HSW activity withmonthly audits, training sessions which has resulted in zero fatalitiesor accidents for the year and no adverse comments by independentauditors. Green bill penetration cross the 75% to end Feb at 76.3%.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance: AP BD at 1.55% ishigher than the target of 1.3%. Invol churn at .67% is higher than thecircle target of .65%. FLV BD is significantly high at 4% while FLVcash collection at 97.1% is below the expected 100% mark. FLD cashcollections at 92.5% is also lower than the 100% target. 0-30 Flowsrates have been at 6.5% against a target of 5%. Collection cost at2.47% is higher than the targeted 2.3%. MPesa usage at 1.54% ofrepayment against the targeted 5% while ECS/SI penetration at 1.69% isbelow the 5% target.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours): AP isahead on the cash collections piece because of the ""speed"" exhibited byAshish in identifying tough months for collections due to holiday &political disruptions and coming up with plans to mitigate the same.100V2V minutes free for habitual late paying customers in August &September ensured highest ever collections in these festival months inthe history of the circle while 10Gm free Silver coins is showingpositive results in October long holiday disruptions. His detailedreviews with the team, persistent follow up in identifying & resolvingissues in Enterprise as well as FLD/FLV cases has started payingdividends with better performance. Process corrections suggested by C&Cincluding post activation verification has helped reduce service issueswith new FLD/FLV customers. Rigorous implementation of HSW toolsincluding refresher training and surprise audits have ensured zeroaccidents and fatalities this year in collections.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours): AP BDat 1.55% is higher than target of 1.3%. This has been brought about bya combination of factors within and outside the control of thecollections team. Post bifurcation of the state, payment on governmentaccounts have virtually dried up with COCP account being unilaterallychanged into IOIP across the state. Non payment/delayed payment of suchaccounts have significantly contributed to BD. Proliferation of Redplans to the wrong profile of customers, add on connections to thewrong base, MPesa customers with lower security deposit who behavederratically all contributed to BD. FLV & FLD collections have sufferedon account of new issues that have cropped up in recent activations. Itis however expected to improve in March when large payments like AmazonMPLS links are paid by the company in FLD. FLV BD is on account of twolarge accounts, Mobishastra & RVR, both frauds which hit the circlebadly to the tune of 27 lacs. Inability to move from the fixed costmodel has resulted in higher cost of collections, a state of affairs,which can only be rectified by getting collection agencies, willing towork on variable pay out, in major upcountry hub locations.Specific Focus on Way Forward: Ashish needs to continue and focus ongetting the basics of collections right in the zones. He needs toensure that detailed reviews are conducted, rigorous follow up of caseshappens. He needs to replicate the same when he travels to zones forhis reviews with ZH's. He needs to take tough call on people and weedout nonperformers faster by identifying them as the year progresses.There needs to be more analysis for the reasons for higher BD like theone done for Red Plan and the MPesa rollout. Identifying these earlycan ensure their withdrawal from the market, thereby curtailing ourlosses.Progress on Development Goals: Ashish needs to work on his Englishcommunication, both verbal and written. He needs to improve hisinteraction with his team and peers who at times feel intimidated byhis aggression and pushy nature.Progress on Career Aspirations: Ashish should continue in his currentrole for at least two more years before he be considered for a changein role. This is important as he is just 12 months into the collectionhead role. This stint will help improve his maturity, leadershipskills, ability to multi task, handle diverse people and situations andimprove his cross functional interaction. Ability to controlaggression, channelize it to get results without sounding or appearingoffensive to others is important and needs to be worked on."
"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Ankur took over as retail lead for the zone in may'14 post her stint inmarketing - acquisitions. She has done fantastically well to settle in,seamlessly and quickly move into the role. She has learnt and alsomastered the nuances of retail function and the knitty-gritty needed toexcel in the same, The zone had big gaps in the retail foot print (VMSexpansions) and also it had to add VS at strategic locations in thecity to maximise postpaid acquisitions in the city. She has led fromthe front in identifying / raising the VS in key locations as part ofexpansion plans. Ankur was quick to identify the gaps and opportunitiesin both of these critically important areas. With expansions andmeticulous execution and eye on daily run rate and governance in place,VS channel was thrusted to exceed tgt and do 117% of Nettgross postpaidnumber apart from many wins in the ancillary kpis and quality front. Inthe team management front too, she has done very well in holding theteam together and align them towards ""one team one dream"" approach andalso maintained lowest attrition function in the zone. Team works in arelaxed and confident manner, making it important for a leader toensure. Handholding of new comers and transferees and effectivedeployment of man power is a big hit for Ankur. Ankur can be a goodleader with large sized teams.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Ankur was able to close 42 budgeted VMS, though the same took two moremonths to establish. This is a big hit when taken into cognizance thegap we had when Ankur took over in May 14. With expansions in place inimportant locations and towns, she has been able to clock 100% ofpostpaid NG tgts for the year.While we started the year with all stores being EBIDTA negative, by Jan,2 of the 8 established stores turned EBIDTA positive and one more onthe verge of turning positive.P2P conversions and their contribution to overall acquisition have movedfrom 20% to 24%.MI penetration has increased and surpassed 50% mark.Prepaid acquisitions done with a good quality of 79% (zone overall at64%). T3M is also very good at 75% (zone 60%). Both quality indicatorshave grown by 10% over respective numbers in 1314.Very good work done on data front with ADVMS and VMS both doubling theirrevenues over LY.EQ scores was a hit with blended scores exceeding 85% in Jan and overallyear clocking 81%WOT and average wait time are both hits with WOT at almost at 100% (98%to be precise) and AWT dropping by more than 2 mins and stayingcomfortably lesser than stipulated time.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:There were misses in the year as well despite having many hits. Firstmiss is ADVMS expansion with Ankur closing 53 against a target of 62.MPESA acquisition tgts missed by a distance.Prepaid acquisition tgt missed at 93% also registered a dip over lastyear by 12%VMS productivity is a miss with19 in Jan right through the year fallingfrom 25 levels.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Ankur had science behind VMS plantings She took insights from cell siteintelligence to identify most suited locations for VMS openings in thecity. She was also quick to close the >50k towns VMS launches. She madegood use of advt support given in identifying prospective CP's. Shealso engaged well with the VMS leads in guiding and motivating them toget the openings done as per plan.Ankur guided her SiCs well on store profitability build up front andimparted enough clarity to them on factors that push and pull storeprofitability. She meticulously deployed and followed profitabilitybuild up matrices and charts at all stores so that the SiC hasvisibility and absolute clarity on the task on hand.As for quality / EQ kpis concerned, Ankur applied herself well inshoring up real numbers. She created a forum of prepaid and VMS leadsas members to discuss all issues that impact scores. Store closuresvisibility was given to all members. Factors that impact quality scores(like probe scenarios and checks / ambience up keep etc) were givenmeticulous attention by Ankur and team.Running of stores was blemishless with proper alignment of team startingfrom regular break-fast meets till periodic reviews of progress withstore teams. KPIs like MI, P2P and EQ indices were driven through teamalignment and focus on executional efficiency. The team under Ankur hasreligiously done their DG activities in neighbourhood and in corporatehouses to shore up numbers.Ankur was also quick to swing into action in addressing businessimpacting issues be it caf compliance / CnC rejections / SNR clearanceetc. / score and fatality reverts - rebuttals etc.Ankur has lived the Vodafone way all through the year with displayingspeed in execution / keeping her approach simple and transparent andensuring there is trust among the team members as well as central team.She has been very honest and upfront in her approach in buildingbusiness and has not taken herself or tolerated any short cuts whentaken by any of the team members.She has been straight forward in implementing HSW practices (seen in hernot hesitating to part with two important members of the associateswhen they were seen violating HSW norms while at work). This would havehelped her have no casualties at all in HSW though the team is morethan 100+ strong and scattered across a huge geography.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Opening up of VMS within timelines was a miss and that was due toopenings going at a slower pace though overall numbers have been put upon board. She couldn't get the VMS leads to quickly close in onprofiles though the analysis on expansion localities was well in placeand on time. Execution took more time than desired time (around 2months delay).Ankur has her share of luck going against her with prepaid acquisitionsat VMS / VS being a miss though the zone was able to do its prepaid acqtgts. Lack of focus by VMS leads in terms of acq from VMS was the causefor the same. With productivity at stake at VMS postpaid front after aflurry of VMS openings, the focus on prepaid thrust was a let go byleads at field level.VMS productivity drop was a miss. Despite opening of enough number ofVMS, postpaid nett-gross stood at just 79% (overall retail NG 100% withthe support of VS). Productivity dropped to as low as 19 numbers while30 should have been ideal and the GHG VMS productivity as per charterwas targeted at 50 nos. VMS leads did not do substantial work inguiding and pushing the VMS CP's towards numbers. VMS CPs, most ofthem, had the tendency to serve only the enquiries that came their wayand enquiries passed onto them by VMS leads, thereby finally beingunable to move the tgts. Hygiene also was a concern in some VMS whichadded to negative sale and compliance issues. There have been misses atCP level in assigning red plans to certain suspect customers which wentunchecked by VMS leads.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Ankur to get the 12th store in the city to get the retail foot printcomplete and robust. She needs to concentrate further on VMSproductivity which holds the key to enter 1516 in order to ensure CPprofitability and sustainability. Only with this, postpaid acquisitionat 100% + would be possible at VMS.Prepaid focus by VMS leads level is a must so that we don't have a scaryyear again on prepaid. She has to further build on the engagementlevels of the team and keep them intact with zero regrettable attritionthrough the year. Team looks forward to her as a leader and she have tocontinue to live up to their expectations. Ankur has to focus on peopledevelopment part as in this year; there are quite a few members of herteam will be queued up for their elevations and role change movements."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Sreedevi has done exceedingly well in churn control which is one of thebiggest focus areas of circle in order to grow our postpaid business.She has clocked numbers better than circle as well as better than bigzones in comparison, in terms of absolute numbers as well as revenue.She has done very well in terms of controlling hni churn. Thecompliance levels on CAF and term compliance are also good hits.Sreedevi has contributed strongly in terms of putting systems andpractices in place to ensure prepaid activation TAT. She has also beena good leader with attritions at 0 levels as well as team being awell-bonded one aligning in a very effective manner towards company'sbroader objectives. Sreedevi is the zonal spoc for interface withnetwork team. She has played an important role in correcting of networkissues in the zone geography which directly impacts not only postpaidsubs but definitely the close-to-0.8 million prepaid subs for whomstickiness solely depends on products availability and network quality.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Revenue churn (2.75% vs 2.95% circle and also lowest in circle) as wellas absolute numbers churn both lesser than circle (net of p2p - 2.25%vs 2.66%)HNI at 1.2%Caf quality at 99% and compliance at 100%Term compliance at 96%<24 hours prepaid TAT at 75% averageTraining and compliance at 100%Champion twice in MPESA score card100% retention of on-roll man power - on time appraisals - top classemployee engagement100% HSW compliance in HSW (KRCC and SPP) - no casualties at allMisses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Though Sreedevi did better than circle in churn control, it is to beagreed that the overall churn ceiling has been exceeded (2.07% vs2.68%)Was unable to retain important and big accounts which churned throughMNP.Huge drop on FTR (68% to 42%)Gross rejects control in retail was a big miss (40% vs allowed 10%)Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Sreedevi was quick enough to identify the issues behind poor performanceof the retentions man power agency and go for necessary correction withthe support of central team. Man power deployment and training holdsthe key for agency level retentions operations, which once used to be aproblem, now ably resolved by Sreedevi.She made model to call out service requests customers pre-emptively sothat the team had better control on forthcoming churn. She had goodcontrol on the man power deployed at stores which was the first levelretention interface. Sreedevi has diligently and frequently madetraining programs for RnR teams across the geography to keep them gluedto the job and also give us feelers on motivation levels. Educating theagents on retention tools and importance of moving in quickly alsohelped Sreedevi clock better numbers despite big accounts churn thathit the overall numbers dearly.Sreedevi did a fantastic work in the MPESA launch and therefore in thedocs compliance levels. This is possible as we know with only clarityof the knitty-gritties surrounding MPESA business. She had the teamstrongly behind her rallying with us during the launch as well as goingforward post launch.Sreedevi as a manager doesn't support or tolerate short cuts in anythingaround document compliance. Aptly doc compliance is such high levelsdue to sheer control on-ground on systems and practices.Sreedevi is among the most active members in the HSW adherence effort atthe zone. She has been involved in Safety committee meetings /implementation of HSW across not only CS function but also in otherfunctions of the zone in conjunction with the respective leads. Thecontrol and the exposure that gave also helped Sreedevi to do aspotless execution in HSW implementation in her own vertical.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Lost big accounts (agri department and Lakshmi Hyundai 900 lines)despite retention efforts. Could have tried more retention tools toretain mnp churning customers. Can play a more active role inidentifying poor quality acquisitions which finally come back to hauntwith churn threat / SNR checks etc.Specific Focus on Way Forward:To play more active role in churn control especially starting with poorquality acquisition and acquisition churn. Quickly implement thechanges in CAF pick up and processing model discussed out for HyderabadCity. Retentions external agency to be working like a well-oiledmachinery and any ground level issues around logistics and efficiencyof the agency to be dealt with steadfast and upfront and quickly.Sreedevi to continue and enhance the support she extends the zone innetwork issues resolution in order to improve prepaid customerexperience."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Anirudh has done great job in Q2 to pull back UB deficit pile up andturn it around .CYN drive was carried out blemishlessy with Aprilgetting 1000 numbers and Sep moving upto 14k numbers. GAS sharemovement is phenomenal and ever highest since long. Data tertiariesgrew well and surpassed 1 Cr mark and bigger than comparable sub basezones by more than 25%. 121movement wrt to outlets and revenuecontribution from april to sep has seen phenomenal movement.Overall good work in terms of acquisition and related areas havehappened therefore there is a movement in sub base now to the tune of25k in H1Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:UB ytd target achievement stands at 97%. Soon YTD shortfall gettingwiped out.GAS% which was around 7.6% in april (march 9.5%) have movedconsistently and reached 14.5%.CYN has reached dizzy heights to scale 14k numbers in Sep and 83% YTDachievement which is the highest in circle.121 outlets reach moved from 18% in april to 36% in sep. 24 lacs wasthe contribution of 121 tertiary which now moved to 50 lacs.Recommended sale was a hit with almost 100% done. DAO saw a goodmovement though being way off tgts.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:o Distribution (overall transacting outlets) shrunk over H1consistently. (Ueo march 11500 Sep 10400)o UB first quarter was a miss thereby leading to sub base erosion andCMS dip. Actuals at 70%o Quality dropped from April to July considerably (71% to 63%).o MPESA customer acquisition and RTT agents tgts way off YTD tgtsdespite a near perfect launch (488/608).o New outlets opening didn't happen anywhere close to needed levels.Numbers being far lesser than decay.o LUT in upcountry on the rise. Vacant locations in AD marketspersisted.o AD appointments in City, after a spurt, not gaining any momentum.o Consumer business in postpaid, after a good start, dipped over Q2 toreach less than 90% achievement.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):After a big drop in Q1, Anirudh and team did well to bounce back in Q2and also made good use of the big input given for KRO's to thrust theUB numbers up. Sensible deployment actually did the job. 121 driveswere done meticulously by all legs on field to get across to 36%retailers (from 18% in april) with the concept. Profit story was soldwell to retailers. Thrust in bonus cards too helped DATA contributionto move up considerably. CYN was a major drive with awareness andprofit story strongly created across markets and here again KRO inputsand qualifiers created carefully and driven to perfection. Retailerengagement was done in a big way in Old City with Iftar Party beingreceived so well from retailers.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Distribution shrunk despite huge inputs given as subsidy in GHG project.Agenda setting on Dbn expansion was missing. Absence of objectivereviewing is prominent reason for the shrinkage. Ward-wise realignmentsstill have gaps in the city. DSE realignment basis optimum size ofbeets didn't happen till end of H1thereby few beets are either too bigto handle or too small to be viable. No reviewing of major db's donein a structured manner so that they were held answerable for inputsgiven.'New outlets' as a pressing need was not recognised by most RM's. PRCoutlets opening not focussed while City db's have dipped in some casesto less than 15% of PRC versus overall tertiary. Db motivation levelscould have been higher with good practices being followed withconsistency (continuance of benefit letters/ plank for DSE recognition,incentive deployment mode etc) City AD deployment has not happened asper plan with just 1 AD appointed in H1.Speed to market could have been much better with month roll outs not tobe allowed to extend to anytime beyond 3 days..MPESA, lack of drive didn't help customer acquisition and RTT reach totargeted numbers.Review with ASM CSM could have been more rigorous and structured (andrecorded) in MBN district (with proper MoM circulated) even as MBNdistrict continued to shrink on Dbn with LUTs and inactive ad's everincreasing and UB tgts continuously being missed.Overall, distribution set up needs a major thrust all over again, toreach exit march '14 levels and then to move to norms.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Nil (as Anirudh has been moved to a different role).Progress on Development Goals:Nil (not mentioned by Anirudh)Progress on Career Aspirations:Nil (not mentioned by Anirudh)APD FeedbackIn H1 Anirudh was DL of Hyd city and H2 he moved as SPM, following isthe feedback of H1Hits and Missesa.

These solution sales not only makes customer toretain for longer periods but mandates any additional link for sameservice provider. This approached made us to crack there major MPLSwins which contributes to 25% of overall links sold. For requirementslike ILL, markets outside the city limits where chosen because citymarkets were flooded by tier 2 and tier 3 providers making the casescommercially non viable and the competition has challenge in matchingthe service offering by Vodafone.

"The overall Admin performance in the first 6 months has been reallydistant from desirable. Despite constant feedbacks by HRH and even BH,little or no progress has been observed on key focus areas, speciallyprojects. There have been multiple escalations on the overall circle /zonal office hygiene issues + MCM experience as end user in multipleforums.The cost optimization initiatives have not been visible in absence ofany bit of benchmarking, cost comparison thoughts etc. The awareness ofownership of Legal compliance and registrations ownership was missingfor the most part of H1 despite being in the Admin head role for 2yrs+.Vijay has not been proactive in updating on the status of registrationsover last quarter despite several times intervention by HRH on thematter.Hard negotiations with Hotels and cost advantage derived has not beenput up in a quantifiable approximation method.New Guest House/ Guest House upgrade has been a very long process andoverly delayed despite constant feedback from HRH, BH and evenexpectation laying down by the OD himself.Exclusive lift for VF in varun Towers has been the only near significantclosure from the Facilities point of view. That itself has been ahugely delayed process though.All projects viz. Vijaywada ZO, Guntur, Kurnool and other projects havebeen all delayed monumentally. This, despite constant follow ups andextension of support by Circle BH, HRH himself and clear laydown ofexpectation by the OD himself. Now the 2 projects are a WIP and allprojects need to be closed before 31st Dec. '14. The delay cannot beexternalized and needs to be project managed end to end by driving allrelevant stakeholders towards closure (including MCM, Finance, SCM &others).The simple request/instruction of Refrigerator and Microwave for alloffices was inordinately delayed causing another issue of hugembarrassment to the Function at large.Several escalations on employee experience while travel (specially MCM).Latenight support extended to Finance / Mktg teams during crunch timesonly on instructions by HRH and not proactively. This was an easy killto build line sponsorship. Was a definite opportunity lost by absenceof proactive thinking and poor customer orientation.In absence of above, the high CSAT scores, if any at all, lose completerelevance.IFM has not been implemented and has come back as a huge concern /feedback fromt he Corporate Facilities team as well.In terms of Team management, Vijay has to cover a lot of ground. Gettinginto tiffs and constant arguments with a new team member is completelyuncalled for. Confessing that nothing can be done to improverelationship with Farheen has certainly been a low point. Vijay needsto manage team by carrying the team along with credibility and earnthat bit of trust and respect. Specially so with the new team member.The effort visible in terms of handholding and onboarding is far frombeing truly visible.HSW has been on a pure minimum maintenance mode. This needs to changeand methods need to be devised to get the complete HSW Reboot for theCircle. A visible action plan awaited.____________________________________________________Feedback from Corporate PFM Head is as given below and I quote :The commitment to identifying Retail store within the location, spaceand cost specifications has been a time consuming effort that Vijay andteam have really worked hard to achieve. There is need for additionalfocus to meet the 3rd & 4th Quarter requirementsI'm sure you would have read the 'Operating spaces ' which is ourfacilities bulletin. Really nice to see it coming together & lookforward to articles from AP as it is a very good platform to shareachievements to all VIL employees.Disappointed to see that IFM hasn't been rolled out. There has beenmultiple reworking of HC and costs done and still no closure, lookforward to completing the discussion in the coming week and targetrollout by December as Ashok's deadline of August is long gone.With Thomas cook empaneled as the national travel service partner and 6north circles rollout completed, looking forward to completing this inthe coming 6 months. It's taken extremely long to close the GH upgrade,the current GH is of very poor standard and needed immediate attention.With the Security policy rolled out, Vijay and team were working on theprocedure manuals that took long and many versions before it got rolledout last quarter. Vijay needs to prioritize and focus on areas ofimprovement needed in the circle & work with the team to make necessarychange.Need to quickly have the zone and branch offices refurbished in linewith the standards detailed, this I'm sure will result in positiveemployee experience and feedback.We must continue our focus on registration of lease agreement &governance on property portfolio.Vijay needs to focus on data accurate and sending it in time whichimpacts analyses and sharing dashboards. He also needs to login andparticipate in VC's.Would like to see more happen on energy saving and sharing of bestpractices with analysis.During the coming months would request special attention on vendormanagement, looking for compliance to the Fast Forward project that wasrolled out a while ago ensuring transparency in empanelment withrelevant feedback and SCM negotiation of all vendors.Considering our continued focus on cost savings, during the next 6months look forward to rationalizing the Housekeeping and security HCwithout compromising on the service or premises security, safetyrequirements. Travel data analysis needs to be done and highlightsshared with the business to manage costVijay needs to mentor and coach his team as Farheen is new to FM andwill need regular reviews and support, this will help Ravi too.As a way forward for H2, Vijay needs to see how to work towards thecomplete Admin overhaul and the function perception correction +earning towards being as an effective Business partner and acheerleader.Long way to go and much-much more to be done.Vijay has been given continuous feedback on poor Admin performance overlast 3-4 months by HRH and BH, but very little or no improvement hasbeen observed.In view of the performance in H1, Vijay will be closely watched to comeup as a leader and an effective business partner deliver impact as aservice center and a conscience keeper to the larger Business.Working to build stature, maturity and gaining Trust is going to be adefinite key focus area.All the best for H2."

"Aditi did well on mobility revenue both voice and non voice and Also BAUrevenues in FLD were above target.Break throughs in ATLAS accounts likeValue Labs, ICFAI, Cura, etc. gave an impetus for Atlas revenues.What-Hits:1) Mobility and FLD revenues for BAU were above target.2) Total FLD Revenue achievement of Business as usual -107.6%3) FLD OB achievement: Business as usual: 151.8%4) Regular updation of comet and switchover to 1SF.5) WAAC+ - 90 percent of orders closed this FY are WAAC+ or fromconnected buildings.How Hits:Relationships and rigorous follow ups were the key in achieving themobility and FLD BAU targets. Also new companies enlistment helpedAditi to open up new avenues for revenues. ICFAI and Mahavir motorswere some of the notable wins in mobility which were predominantly ledby relations in these accounts. On the FLD front Value labs and ICFAIwere the major contributor's. Aditi adapted well to the change in SFAtool from Comet to 1 SF. With most of the FLD orders coming fromconnected buildings helped her in faster revenue realisation.

Weak Pipeline on newproducts led to non achievement of New product revenues. Also highdependency on few customers for mobility and not enough deskpermissions hampered the conversion from hunting to farming.Way Forward: Aditi is will be moving to VF group in product management.I am sure with the kind of potential she displays, She will besuccessful in the new role. I wish her all the best.DEVELOPMENT GOALS:On the developmental goals Aditi is yet to attend workshop on VWS thoughsome of the elements of the workshop are captured in 1 SF.

Adverse impact seen w.e.f Oct 2014.VBS for VMS Overall Revenue Achievement @ 42% till Dec 2014 Dashboard.Revenue Achievement is at 5.15 Mn against a Target of 12.37 Mn. Effortswith Retail team yielded no successful results, during the year.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:There is a lot scope of improvement in VBS 4 VMS. this has not reallytaken off.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):All projects were very well monitoredFor VEPP, VCL & Phoenix - Regularly met all PAM's and channel partnersfor regular updates on performance. Plotted MIS & reports to ensurevisibility of what is expected to be delivered. Monthly Feasibilityreport in place to track feasibilities count raised.For Syndicates - Good engagements in key syndicates to help withbusiness 4 Syndicate Tie ups done in 2014-15 - Second Highest count ofTie ups done for this year across all circles. 6 Events done in thisyear. Database of members shared with SME Team to aid conversions.Syndicate Tagging of Conversions in place.Atlas Enlistment process & Retagging has been closely monitored.For Gurukul - FOS Trainings was driven till Sep 2014 & process gapsobserved thereafter.For VBS for VMS - Multiple attempts made to engage with Retail team toensure VMS are successful, no movement seen here. Revenue achievementis largely due to Mobility & FLD conversions pushed for. Other VBSproducts are not seen in conversions.Specific Focus on Way Forward:She should work closely with the PAMs to help drive key projects andhave a complete overview of the SME business includingsales/distribution and channel partner appointment and training. Thiswill help her develop as a future segment head.Progress on Development Goals:Work in progressProgress on Career Aspirations:Ashrita is interested in moving into a SME segment head role or customerservice head. She has the potential for either of these roles. Sheshould focus on getting broader exposure in the current role she is into give her a business perspective.Arvind Sharma Comments:Ashrita is progressing well on her projects & trends are positive . Withthe more rigor & focus H2 is bound to be turning out fantastic and thiswill add to the Top Line of segment.Phoenix , Atlas , Syndicates are moving pretty well & in phoenix we arefiguring out in Top-3 nationally .This is result of immense focus andregular reconciliation of MIS with SSC .VBS 4 VMS could have done much better with the retail team support,which seems to have diluted a bit because of their other importantagenda in priority .However with the regular direct interaction ofAshrita with zonal retail team , somehow holding onto numbers .VEPP & VCL need to be driven with little more efforts and closecoordination with Channel Partners and PAM's on regular basis . Newchannel partners should be groomed and aspired to be part of VEPP tier.Gurukul is running good and best part is ,all the PAM's & CP's haveunderstood significance and importance of certification and value addto the productivities of their manpower .This should keep drivenregularly without compromising effectiveness of program .Syndicates revenues achievement at 94% , could have been better furtherwith engagement and activities done with more nos of local associations. Though activities were done in Hyd & Sec'bad zones however ourobjective to establish relationships & business activities with minimum1 asso/zone is still to be met . Ashrita should start focussing more inROAP locations to drive same .VBS 4 VMS can certainly do better if seriousness of retail team isbrought back to the project . In the current scenario , so far, goodwork done with direct engagement of zonal retail teams by ensuringproper support .With the strong MIS system in place , Ashrita has been able to deliverrelevant & timely insights to all the stake holders . This is helpingsales team to alter / modify their plans - partner wise / fos wise tomeet their targets .This is happening by calling/visitng partners andshowing them dash boards on performance of all business parameters -how much achieved and how much to be done .This creates moreseriousness & urge to achieve among sales people .VEPP benefits are getting transferred to Channel Partners in a waydefined by corporate team .Operating plan has been implemented as per parameters set by corporateteam and has seen traction in the last 3 months. Out of 6 parameters 3are moving in right direction and balance needs to be driven with morefocus. Should try to achieve max percentage of achievement no mattertargets are set very inspirational.This will happen working hand in glove with PAM's & Channel partners.ROAP will get maximum leverage if driven appropriately.SIP files are being sent within time to HO & HR for validation 7submission for disbursement. Achievement %age is lower than 80% , thisis primarily due to non-achievement in OB in FLD also owing to networkcapacity . Should work towards monitoring healthy funnel of PAM's .VCL qualification is underachieved hence require more work to do .Ashrita is progressing well on her functional developmental goal bylearning the nitty gritty of the business. Exposure to central team andparticipation in various forums & meetings are really helpful makinglearning's richer. Shall work soon on enhancing skills on subjects -Decision making , Change Management ."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Data revenue @ 104% of DB. Key inputs to drive the data growth like DataStar 2.0, Contextual Content seeding, 121 for data have helped. DataStar 2.0 helped the organization reorient themselves to new challengesand opportunities of data business like data at the time ofacquisition, base mining and 121 on prepaid. Work done towards Contentpromotion has been the first of its kind amongst circles with the useof Touchpoint, create a basket of content linked to festivals and testmultiple verbiages to get an understanding of customer-content linkage.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Data revenue @ 104% of DB. 3G UU crossed 2Mn subscribers and we areahead of 3G UU target in both postpaid and prepaid. Data usage has alsobeen on target on DB.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performanceWhile data has achieved its targets, it is riding on 3G in both revenueand UU. 2G is below DB in prepaid with 90% achievement. In postpaidboth 2G and 3G pack achievement are below DB at 87.7% and 94.6%respectively. Also data pack tertiary in prepaid is seeing a slow-downand is below targets since Aug, growing at <3% in Aug and Sep and Octgrowing at <5%.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Data Star was reoriented to the needs of the financial year and businesschallenges. Data at the time of acquisition was spotted as anopportunity and a new constellation Pegasus was formed. The problemstatement with base management team was identified and therefore KPI'srealigned to incremental revenue. In the prepaid segment, key inputparameters like 121 and data at the time of acquisition was introduced.Good display of problem statement definition and analyticalsolutioning.Content - good initiative taken on Ganpati and Navratri. First time everthe content promotion was a good package of use of Touchpoint, creationof a good content bank, testing of various verbiages and tracking ofresults. This has been showcased and appreciated by senior management.The entire approach towards the brief given on 'Let's leveragefestivals' was well thought through and program well established. Gooddisplay of innovative thinking and going beyond the brief.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):1. Speed. 2 examples to demonstrate this : Data star 2.0 was re-launchedin July. Data star was losing steam as cross functional participationand discussion were on from Q1 to make changes to invigorate it. Welost the entire Q1 and we launched the renewed version in July. 121 asa parameter was introduced in Data Star in July. The feedback from themarket was to make offers more relevant, reduce the stretch given tocustomers, have more than one data offer like competition does and havea data offer for each and every customer. While 121 was introduced inData star as a input parameter, the changes in data offers were madeonly in Oct, when the voice team was relaunching 121. Critical timelost. 121 should have been made relevant to the sales team since it wasa critical parameter in 121. Data tertiary since Aug has been growinglower than expectation in prepaid. Problem statements needs to beanalysed and action taken with speed to do course correction. It's been3 months and we have yet not been able to pin point to reasons for slowdown.2. Connect with the cross functional teams and market. Data star is akey engine to get all functions aligned to leverage the dataopportunity. Connect with teams to drive them to achieve targets andwork along with them could have been much better. Making the DataStartargets and R&R is just the start. It is the ability to drive it withteams which make the difference, especially when trend line showed manypostpaid team de-growing. Srikar needs to reorient himself fromstrategy to action and influence without authority.3. Ability to adopt ideas given by others. Many inputs have been givenlike tracking of pack UU as a dashboard and working towards it toachieve the target, various inputs on analysis of reasons for slowdownin data, visit the various functions like prepaid market, call centreand stores to understand the reason for low participation, reorientoutbound telecalling campaign for better results and tracking, use ofChordiant to ensure we get incremental revenue. However there isreluctance to take up ideas generated by others and drive them. Itrequires a lot of follow ups from managers.4. Team management. This is a feedback given in earlier year MYPD/APD aswell. Srikar is a good individual worker. He is good at analysis.However he needs to engage a lot more with the team to get them tothink and drive the business. The team should themselves be coming upwith analysis of their portfolio and discussing way forward. The teamneeds to be involved in critical aspects like weekly revenue projectionand yearly budgeting. Only when the team does weekly projections, willthey understand the gap areas and develop higher accountability. Healso needs to drive to team to have higher connect with the market andcross functions. He can do that either by leading by example orensuring thet market visits are adhered to.Specific Focus on Way Forward:1. Srikar is a good individual team member. He needs to start engagingand working a lot more cohesively with other departments and get histeam to do that as well. For which he needs to start connecting withthe last mile to understand their challenges so that he can take ideasto implementation. Show initiative and take the lead.2. Needs to push himself and his team to think differently or capitalizethe ideas that come forth from others. This needs to be throughdemonstration of speed.3. Srikar is good with analytics and data but he gets to also getoverwhelmed with it or others with it. He needs to learn to crystalizehis thoughts so that the right information is given out.4. Needs to work on team management by guiding them with more discussionon way forward, new things to do and build a second line for himself.5. Connect with the market and various department to capitalize onstrategy with action and execution rigour needs to be improved. Thisbecomes very relevant with Srikar moving a new role in Bangalore,SRIKAR NEEDS TO TAKE TRADE ENGAGAMENT IN KARNATAKA AT TE HIGHEST LEVELand he comes with a great promise, plus initial few activities showsthe trajectory towards the desired goal"

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 6 months:CSG has performed well as per expectations in the areas of activationalongwith realignment of roles in line with OE.Self help penetration and usage of My VF app alongwith the revenue scaleup through self help channel has been significant and on track as pernational targetsIn terms of people career progression and realignment of roles, therehas been a significant move to optimise the resources and align to theOE. Movements planned were in line with people's tenurity in the roleand further succession plan.CBO rollout at Chennai and 100% migration to EBO was completed by CSGduring the year as planned.Initiation of new A2 offices through new partner NSB was also carriedout as per plan.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Self help penetration and RevenuesMisses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Complaints per 000 sub, Repeats, WCOM, etc were a big miss vs targetPerformance at EBO across KPI's not too satisfactoryPrepaid Activations : Slow down in Jan '15.

This has a direct impact ofchurn, NPS and customer experience.TERM compliance.. performance has dipped to <95%, there is an immediateneed to recover on the deviations observed and ensure compliance >95%consistently.Feedback:In the capacity of CSG head role, you are required to set the goalsclear for each team and ensure timely direction to the teams to achievethe set goals. CSG needs to ensure complete support to the frontline todeliver better experience and resolution and initiate processimprovements based on RCA to deliver end resolution to the customers.Santosh really needs to bring in a change in terms of looking at longterm needs of the circle and driving the CSG objectives through directteams and various cross functional teams for continuous improvement andenhanced results."

Shefali has complete understanding of the Telecalling Business and hasbeen managing it over a period of time. Shefali also brings with herthe required maturity and stature to handle the Teams of Telecallersand Field Agents. She has been able to work at maintaining numbers andthen gradually growing them while the basic policies towardsAcquisition and Verification kept changing. She has been able to dothis because of her in-depth knowledge of the business and the process.She has also been able to adapt herself to changing needs by moving amajority of the business towards MNP unlike last year which was on P2Pand Add-on. This required a change in focus and constant training ofthe telecallers. She has been able to do this by orgainising constantrefresher Trainings to the Team and constantly monitoring the qualityof the pitch. This year also unlike previous years she has been able tomove the business from one partner to now 3 partners who doTelecalling. This is the first time that she has moved into expansionof agencies and has been able to do the same satisfactorily. Shefalihas not been able to add manpower in the year and the total telecallershave reduced. This despite increase in agencies has been due toreduction in Business because of change in policy and should have beencontrolled better. The churn also continues to be matter of concern asboth 0-60 and 0-90 days churn has increased over the year speciallycompared to last year. This has also impacted ARPU as that has gonedown this year compared to last year.Shefali has the maturity to handle larger roles like Retention Head orRetail Sales/ Quality but due to current locational constraints isunable to move from the current profile.
"Being in this profile for 10 years now, Harish is well versed with theP&FM lead portfolio that he manages. He brings with himself strongunderstanding in Property & Facilities Management and HSW domain. Adependable team member. Harish in addition to his portfolio brings thestrength of having a good networking with the external community whichtime and again has helped in terms of gaining business prospects aswell as managing tough environmental situations.Hits:Harish has ensured a non-negotiable safety culture across the circle.Various circle safety interventions rolled out during the year byHarish and his team including Spot the 8th ASR contest, Safety tags forcars, Swine Flu campaign, Earthquake awareness Awareness on new HSWpolicy. Safety passport process has been implemented with rigor. Day 1HSW induction is being ensured for every new joinee. He ensures 100%safety compliance and checks during and throughout all events.Zero liasioning cost continues to be a key strength for the circle.Harish highlighted the gaps w.r.t. a national travel vendor billingprocess which helped in correction of the process which was leading toextra billing by the vendor.Project Spring has been delivered well effectively partnering with theRetail team.The budgeting exercise was handled with all details which led tooptimizing the cost as per the overlays without impacting theexperience.Harish has also gone beyond his duties by supporting in getting theNHRM account, the biggest one so far for MPesa business.Initiatives like Healthcare portal and Global Wellness Challengechampionship have been owned and driven well.Cafeteria services have been enhanced and there has been a completeturnaround towards employee experience.Thomas cook as the travel partner has been rolled out smoothly in thecircle.Staff function cost has been maintained within budgets.Misses:The basement project was delayed because of inaction for months andthis impacted business as we had to surrender a large portion of thecapex.The Rohtak project kick off was also slow and the closure onidentifying and closing the location was a very slow process. This ledto last minute approvals at Corporate level which eventually could notbe received owing to change in guidelines. Ultimately, the Capex had tobe surrendered there as well.With the potential that Harish carries, impactful initiatives toimprove efficiencies/ processes and enhance employee experience weremissing during the year.There was 1 WR fatality because of Expect the Unexpected. A whitepaper was made in partnership with Sales team and released capturingthe learnings of all promotional activities and shared with Corporateand all circles.Missing on the career advancement opportunities like Punjab andGujarat have been a miss for Harish.Additional feedback from Suzzane:As Thomas cook has been introduced as the travel partner, going forward,car hire & stay arrangements too needs to be brought undercentralization.We must continue our focus on registration of lease agreement &governance on property portfolio. Would like to see more happen onenergy saving and sharing of best practices with analysis.During the coming months would request special attention on vendormanagement(including timely vendor payments), looking for compliance tothe Fast Forward project that was rolled out a while ago ensuringtransparency in empanelment with relevant feedback and SCM negotiationof all vendors.Harish being one of the IFM core members there has been a delay in IFMrollout, but its finally completed, though not convinced about the costincrease. Good to see that TC as the travel agency has been rolled out& I'm sure the MIS generated is useful to drive cost savings. Harishneeds to send data in time, reminders are required especially for the 5ypp. While BC for circle office expansion in the basement was signedmonths ago, project hasn't begun and not sure if the capex has beenapproved yet. Would be good to follow approval procedure and avoidGovernance issues in the property portfolio.Harish needs to accept & drive change, rollout of the national servicefor security management with HC rationalization during the comingmonths is important.With the focus on cost efficiencies this year would definitely wantHarish to focus on reducing the G&A costs - facilities, security,utilities & travel sharing best practices and looking for opportunitiesto bring down the cost.Harish should have applied for the Gujarat PFMH position, it would havegiven him new challenges and learning, he has spent many years in thesame circle .All the best Harish for the year aheadWay forward:With his strong background and knowledge, there is an opportunity toroll out and showcase initiatives in 'Operating spaces'- the nationalfacilities bulletin.Travel data analysis needs to be done and highlights shared with thebusiness to manage cost .Zonal SPOCs need to be a part of the IFM structure asap.Developmental inputs:Being as an intervener, Harish's intent is to improve theprocess/highlight the gap, but his way of communication sometimescreates friction/conflict situations. A more empathetic articulationwill help.While he is one of the most dependable person in the hour of need, butin general a more flexible and people friendly image needs to be builtespecially as HR and Admin staff is expected to be the mostapproachable in any organization.Career inputs:As Harish has spent considerable amount of time in the same role, hemust now capitalize upon his strengths and understanding and move intoa different profile to enhance his learning curve. He has all thecapabilities to take up the P&FM head role for any medium as well aslarge circle. He may also opt for cross functional movement where hecan utilize his skills and competencies in the areas of say HSW orExternal networking."

The team also needs to follow a higher degree ofrigour in tracking competition beyond what is reported by the salesteam viz base rate changes, products portfolio benchmarking, segmentedoffers tracking - this is critical in order to be able to respond withspeed.Specific Focus on Way Forward:The role of large investments in Network - 2G & 3G, ICR, SKH and MNP onrevenue enhancement must constantly be kept in mind. It is alsoimportant to give adequate focus on monitoring competition initiativesand reacting fast wherever required. Monitoring new team member's onboarding and relatively weaker team member's performance, giving themtimely feedback and inputs. Institute strong systems to drive regularprocesses like revenue projections so that quality time is spent onvalue adding analysis rather than follow up."

Priti brings with her a rich experience of sales and planning and hasbeen able to execute her tasks with required maturity. She has donethat by building credibility with the Team and also proving them withLeadership at required intervals. Priti has take up ownership of mostof her KPI's and also been able to execute most of them well. Priti forexample has been able to implement the SIP parameters very well in theCircle. She has also ensured that RM's not earning incentives are awareof the reason for the same and that corrective action is being taken.Not only has she been able to drive the SIP Incentives she has alsobeen able to build the monthly RM and ASM rankings very well. She hasbeen instrumental in ensuring that the ratings are released on time andthat there is clarity on the parameters. Priti has also beeninstrumental in driving R&R like PSR and Bond rankings. She is singlehandedly responsible for organizing the Bond Function and has beendoing the same regularly. Priti needs to do far more value addition tothe Sales Process. Things like Gate Meeting and FCLC have to be drivenwith far more rigor. The ownership on DSE and PSR incentives also hasto be taken by her. Also new initiatives like tracking of RM's have tobe initiated and taken to their logical conclusion. For Priti now tomake a mark she needs to do things which would differentiate herselffrom other SPM's and initiate Best Practices in the Circle. She alsohas to ensure that regular training being conducted is updated and thatit remains relevant.Priti needs to spend this year in adding value to the entire process andas expressed earlier have atleast two initiatives which should becomeNational Best Practice.
"Anuradha has completed one year as Zonal Head after having come fromoutside the industry. She has used this year to try to learn the basicsof Distribution.Hits:1. Infrastructure - The Zone has the highest Target Achievement for UEOand UAO in the Circle on a month on month basis. This has happened dueto the orientation of the Team towards achieving Infrastructure Targetson a month on month basis. Also incase of DSO there has been a growthin DSO compared to April while the Circle has not shown any growth.2. VAC2 - In terms of VAC2 Target vs Achievement Rewari Zone has thehighest % achievement for the last 6 months. This has happened due tothe Target orientation of the Team and the Drive that the frontlineTeam has.Misses:1. RES - Between April to October Rewari is the only Zone wherein wehave lost RES in absolute numbers. The RES for the Zone has reduced by2528 numbers while Idea, Airtel, BSNL and Docomo have all shownpositive RES movement. This has come across because of inconsistency ofperformance and poor quality.2. Tertiary - While the Tertiary has increased by 10% on a YoY basis inSeptember for the Circle the same for Rewari Zone has only been 6%against a 10% and 13% growth for other Zones. This has happened due tolack of focus on the basics like quality of Acquisition and quality ofmarket servicing. The Zone has also not been able to expand the numberof Channel Partners and as a Zonal Head Anuradha needs to focus onthese basics.3. Quality - The Zone's quality has shown a steady detoriation over thelast few months. The Circle's T3M has improved from 66% in April to 68%in September Rewari Zone T3M has gone down from 71.3% in April to 67.9%in August. There has been a clear lack of focus on taking absolutecorrective actions for improving quality. Micro understanding of theissues and understanding of outlet level quality has been missing. Alsothe AD's where the poor quality has been coming from have not beenaddressed properly. In future Anuradha has to get into the details ofreasons for poor quality and control the same.4. Data - DSO as a % of UEO is at 43% while for the Circle it is at 46%.Data Tertiary also as a % of total Tertiary is only at 5% while for theCircle it is 7%. Anuradha has not been able to change the thoughtprocess of the Team with regards to data focus. In a Zone wherein wehave more than 33% of RES data is an important KPI which would help usin strengthening our Leadership further.5. MNP - While as a Circle we have grown in terms of MNP Rewari Zone hasde-grown in terms of MNP. From a number of 5538 in March it has reducedto 2700 in July and 3000 in August. This despite the fact that RewariZone has the highest RES share and hence also a good opportunity toincrease MNP numbers. Also the same has been discussed many times withher at various points of time. Going forward she needs to focus on theMNP opportunity and ensure that it is used for further strengtheningthe Zone's RES Share.6. M-Pesa - Addition of Agents for M-Pesa has been a focus area whereinRewari Zone has not shown much traction. During launch the Zone wasable to fulfill the Agents requirement the same has not been the caseafter the launch. In the period from January to September the Zone hasbeen able to add only 592 Agents against a Target of 893 Agents. Thetime taken to get the RTT done for the Agents is also very high for theZone.

"Comments by Prashant Chaudhary:- Overall Performance: Cuttack Zone is the largest and the strongestzone in Odisha circle. Vikas as a zonal head has successfully leveragedour market position to achieve satisfactory results in H1 2014. Cuttackzone has a good team and has some of the exceptional performers. Vikashas managed his team well to ensure desired results. Cuttack zone haswon zonathon in Q1 which is an indication of superior comparativeperformance.- Hits (What Part): Vikas has done good job in spread of distributionreaching next level by focusing of DSO / Premium BC outlets and 121outlets in 98% of 500+ pop towns. A lot of prepaid channel correctionwas done to strengthen market servicing. Urban extraction improvementwas highest in his zone. He has also given enough thrust on buildingSME channel infra by appointing SME CP at Balasore and Angul whichhelped to scale up SME business.- Misses (What Part): Vikas missed couple of big agenda points. Anopportunity was missed to make Balasore first branch to become CMSleader. Also being largest zone with strong channel and market hold,handheld implementation could have been done in more efficient manner,particularly on paper billing compliance. Also CMS gain should havebeen substantial so that it would have helped in revenue upside.- Hits (How Part): Vikas is a good task master and holds peopleaccountable for the job they supposed to deliver. Team looks up to himin case of any challenging situation and Vikas ensures the promptsupport to them. Vikas has bonded team well which is delivering abetter performance and setting benchmark for the circle.- Misses (How Part): Building a strategy around a business issue or anopportunity is an area of development for Vikas as a zonal head. Vikasis a great implementer and should leverage this strength to formulate agood strategy to grow the business. He also should build his visibilityaround other circle functions and add larger value in circle businessdevelopment.- Way forward: Vikas has now taken over a larger role in UPE circle. Heneeds to leverage his operational understanding in devising aneffective strategy to build his new zones' business further. He needsto make himself visible more effectively and start adding value tocircle team to devise initiatives to build circle business further."
"Amitabh has made some significant progress on the PFM and facilitiesagenda. He has built a cohesive and strong team which is self drivenand charged to deliver. His personal touch with own team is high. Hecan focus on mentoring the team to enable them in their careers andengaging proactively and assertively with cross-functionalstake-holders. Keeping all stake-holders informed and engaged is key tosuccess. He also has to actively built his persona as a ""leader"" of theadministration team by being more assertive, influential andindividually engaging through communicating his pov and presentingideas and controls that drive a culture of professionalism anddiscipline. A greater degree of formal reviews, involvement andquestioning / audits of critical admin areas is much needed on aregular basis. Evolve a dashboard that highlights critical aspects ofthe vertical and alerts on any dependencies / risks.Good to see that Amitabh has moved onto the travel vendor Thomas Cook,would have liked to see reduction of circle travel spocs dependency.Sharing the MIS and dashboards will be useful to control Travel cost.Had asked for a vendor evaluation to be completed considering the issuearound car payments, haven't received any response or update on thesame. Amitabh must have more control over the property portfolioinfluencing decisions on space eg. The Kanpur BC that kept going arounddue to lack of control over the business demand, propertyidentification. Would have liked IFM getting rolled out earlier in theyear & therefore zone spoc's are not yet a part of the IFM structure,it must be completed in April now. Amitabh needs to rollout thenational service partners for Guest House by April and once finalizedsecurity management with HC rationalization during the coming months.With the focus on cost efficiencies this year would definitely wantAmitabh to focus on reducing the G&A costs - facilities, security,utilities & travel sharing best practices and looking for opportunitiesto bring down the cost.The commitment to identifying Retail store within the location, spaceand cost specifications has been a time consuming effort that Amitabhand team have really worked hard to achieve. We are tracking well andI'm sure will meet the requirements. Happy to see that data is accurateand sent well in time which has helped analyses and sharing thedashboards. Amitabh participates in calls and willing to sharelearnings.It's the commitment and effort from Amitabh that helped rolling outThomas cook as the travel partner in UPE. This I'm sure like all changewill take more time and effort to stabilize as we now need them tomanage car hire & stay arrangements too under the centralization.Amitabh has Contributed to the ""Process Improvement Project"" on MIS dataanalysis that is near completion. This will be useful to have a morerealistic dashboard and budget v/s actual comparison.Good to see that the zone & branch offices are being refurbished in linewith the standards detailed and will reflect in positive employeeexperience and feedback. We must continue our focus on registration oflease agreement & governance on property portfolio.IFM Rollout: Amitabh has supported tremendously on moving to IFM. Q1 isgoing to be extremely critical to ensure service levels are notsacrificed due to move to IFM.Considering our continued focus on cost savings, look forward torationalizing and stricter questioning on wasteful expenses. Traveldata analysis needs to be done and highlights shared with the businessto manage cost. There will be huge pressure on driving austeritymeasures and a big portin of cost control has to be driven by admin andfacilities team. Identify proactively & upfront with your team theopportunities for cost control without taking a hard hit onsatisfaction. Become more questioning about unwarranted expenses.'Operating spaces ' requires more articles from UPE as it is a verygood platform to share achievements to all VIL employees. Admin ESATinternal survey is on and I am confident we will have a great feedback.Good effort on establishing a dashboard and rigorous review for costcontainment with ZH's. Can drive more on cost savings by being moredemanding from vendors on price and extracting about 10% additionalsavings over current price.Facilities management has been a good show. Store identifications,expansion projects, CO cafeteria new look are excellent deliveries.Taxi utilization was showing good trend initially but in last couple ofmonths the utilization has decreased. Need to improve on this stat andimplement train travel process rigorously. Following the FRSinvestigation, we discovered that there was skew in allocation towardscouple of vendors. This aspect presented lot of learnings and you havemade efforts in establishing immediate correction including onlineallocation, dashboard and measures that prevent abuse of individualroles. Be personally involved on this agenda and audit more frequently.The agreements with cab vendors also has to be reviewed with accuracyfor vehicle details, vendor details etc. Transition of diesel fillingcontact to independent agreement was a good move.We are noticing good compliance & control of HSW processes for employees& our direct associates. Amitabh & his vertical lead has taken keeninterest to make the big 5 initiatives on HSW successful. The passionand spirit to make sure those initiatives receive a national attentionmust continue and Amitabh must drive these from the front. Amitabh canbe more demanding from functions and stake-holders on the complianceand the ""feel from within"" aspects of HSW, and Wellness. Insist onattendance and question deliveries by EL / SEL and SPOCS. A lot ofinitiatives can be planned on off-the-job safeties which go a littlebeyond awareness aspects. Safety passport issuance and push to get itdone was well managed. Proactive analytics (business dashboard) onfacility risks, safety and facility questions, and analytics aroundaccess and visitor management details will provide useful insights tobusiness. Insurance cover for all 1@risk is yet to be implemented.Fit4Life design was well executed however the steam behind it has gonemissing in H2. Need a far more engaging set of activities underWellness program / Fit4Life. Local level programs on wellness which aretailor-made to their requirements will help. iClinic Care should beleveraged here.Periodic monitoring of legal cases are required. Push for more closuresin timely manner. Legal cases are far too more at UPE. You can be moredemanding in making sure all get closed quickly and we do not lingerwith them.Kanpur facility identification and business case signing finallyhappened. We need quick action to make sure new facilities and branchoffices are delivered by April / May. Circle office cafeteria foodquality is a perennial subject and that has to monitored for quality,consistency, cost, nutrition and appeal. Change of Vendor / additionalvendor / Alternate choices have to be seriously looked into andimplemented. Publish stats on food quality, food wastage, cafeteriaonly services survey. You have to keep pressure on the vendor anddemand better quality all the time. Office boy uniform changeover was agood move, Cafeteria committee has to work efficiently and day-to-daychecks should be strong.Event management facilitation has been done seamlessly. There is a goodbonhomie between facilities, commercial and marcom and other functionswho own the events. Safety measures in all events have to be kept inmind and pre& post event safety checks have to be carried out as norm.GH house running & maintenance is going on well. There has to beregular checks on service level & administrative discipline. Would likeyou to be extra assertive in your role as a admin head and off-beatchampion in demanding greater employee participation with energy tojustify the time, effort and cost involved in events. Do push thelimits to make sure we have classy stuff in our office facilities whichis appealing and cost friendly.You must review all vendors and have the SCM negotiate the partnersrather than assume that all is well since things are running smoothly.Be more clued into vendors partners with quarterly reviews to avoid anyconflict of interest in the transactions. Your personal due diligenceand critical review of your team, vendors, and associate partners ismuch needed. FRS incident was a damper in H1 phase.You have a very balance and calm attitude which is a great asset in anadmin role. You need to become more demanding, assertive, visible andincrease your last mile connect & influence over Circle managers andemployees. More zonal visits to all zones and branches, open houses,self connect have to be undertaken. There is still a hesitation thatemployees carry in reaching out to you proactively. I suggest youmingle more with all employees, managers, leaders etc in CO. Beingviewed as a ""leader"" of the administration team requires an assertiveeffort and a larger executive presence than you currently project. Workconsciously to be more visible, assertive with your point of view.While you make an effort of preparing and making presentations, increasethe effort on communication skills, public address and work toconsciously avoid switching back to speaking in Hindi. Seize any givenopportunity to address large gathering and sharing your views. Conversemore in English. Build on a persuasive communication style with flare.Execute all things classy. Build deeper audits and alerts in thedepartment activities so that we get advance signals in case of anywrong-doings. Drive a culture of discipline around office time, costconsciousness etc.Finally, your passion and push to refresh NCT team is noteworthy. Youare a fabulous cricket player and asset to the circle for driving thepassion called cricket !!Going forward you must aim for achieving larger roles including applyingfor suitable vacancies in other circles / corporate and positions thatinterest you. Amitabh needs to be mobile moving to another circle asPFMH and explore new territories sharing & learning as he has been inthe current circle since joining. All the best Amitabh for the yearahead.Wishing you all the best for the next FY.Rohit"

New store productivity should be tracked basisthe established stores in Lucknow.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Arpita must look at improving the channel productivities and fast tracknew VMS opening. ADVMS should be seen as an opportunity area. Addedbenefits of having a TOM in the zone should lead to better CCEproductivities with store profitability as the main objective.

Also, as someonehandling one of the largest teams in the zone, ability to handlematters objectively and tactfully in a balanced manner with both peersand team members is crucial."

"Sanjeev has moved into a bigger role and taken charge of a hugegeography of Punjab/HP/JnK. Has established himself well as the PFMhead for a bigger team with senior team mates. Sanjeev and team haveworked hard and ably supported the recovery from the impact of floodsin Srinagar and mainlining the Customer view in most things that arebeing delivered. The Topping of Charts for CSAT survey is a proof ofthe customer oriented delivery.What Hits:Being among the Top 3 for Admin CSATWithin budget with controls established for spends and building savingsthe team did well to account for significant savings during the year.Governance of Zonal reviews has been put in place and compliance /adherence to policy and controls thereby have been well built.IFM rollout was done in time with Punjab/HP being among the Northpioneers.Infra support in terms of the temporary office for Srinagar employeesand aiding the quick recovery post floods by standing ground andfacilitating smooth relief work was commendable.Support for Retail Spring was well delivered with acknowledgement fromthe user department.Cafetaria changes and continued focus for a better employee experienceWhat Misses:How Hits:Sanjeev comes across as an agile communicator is articulate, usesappropriate language to make a point. He deals with conflictconstructively knows how to handle team issues and solves themconstructively. Comes across an unbiased and fair, good in givingdirect feedback. Sanjeev has been to manage a big team with senior teammembers well. Sanjeev has been to partner the leadership team in mostissues related to infra and office space.How Misses:Sanjeev needs to connect more with zonal heads and other vertical headsand manage the relationships with departments where his dependenciesare there for delivery a little better by becoming demanding yet remainpolite. He needs to look beyond his vertical of PFM and needs to seethe larger picture with end customer in mind.The delay in moving to permanent office in Srinagar on account of spaceidentification being lax at times as well as no Plan B approach has ledto crisis being managed many a times by him.Clear need for tasking the team for raising the bar of performance on aconsistent manner rather than only rising to an occasion.Offices have been delayed and time taken for the overall project is waydelayed owing to approvals.HSW is clearly an are which needs more ownership from Sanjeev as well asteam. Timelines on various reports and multiple times have been missedwith accuracy in question too. The execution of well conceptualizedprograms like ACE has been below par with only half of what was plannedgetting delivered within timeline and that too without the desiredimpact.Going forward he needs to focus on things with a little more eye fordetail so as to create and identify opportunities for continuedemployee delight. In the delivery of speed the focus on quality as wellas larger impact on stakeholders should not be missed.In the year ahead the acquisition of infra for the new offices at Zonesand Srinagar MSC is critical along with a consistent continued focusand drive on costs, building systems and robust processes along withHSW rigour.Suzanne's comments:Considering the natural calamity in Srinagar and the politicalenvironment Sanjeev has delivered on the operations agenda for thecircle. Sanjeev should focus on speedy delivery of solutions, there hasbeen delays in the office and MSC location finalization in Srinagar.Team has worked on timely selection of retail site. While IFM has beenrolled out there continue to be challenges in service delivery, Sanjeevmust support with solutions and also use the resources HC efficiently.While TC has been rolled out for the travel solution, there can behigher savings by analysing the reports and sharing the same with thebusiness for better travel planning. Sanjeev need to send data in timeeg. 5 ypp, hotel list.Disappointed to see that the zone spoc's are not yet a part of the IFMstructure, it must be completed in April. Sanjeev needs to rollout thenational service partners for Guest House by April and once finalizedsecurity management with HC rationalization during the coming months.With the focus on cost efficiencies this year would definitely wantSanjeev to focus on reducing the G&A costs - facilities, security,utilities & travel sharing best practices and looking for opportunitiesto bring down the cost."

He engaged with Infra partners &Nokia and worked to improve the uptime and provide punch point freesites for new rollout sites . The ambition to move up the dashboardfrom being amongst one of the last circles to being at second slot inthe HSW helped channelize efforts in building a Safe network.How: Misses : Uptime target of 99.75% was missed. The instabilitybecause of heavy snowfall in Almora area of Uttrakhand and Criticalowner/capturing issues at few sites and IP operator not resolve theissues. Further, partners (NSN, Indus, Bharti, VIOM etc) need to bedriven to a deeper involvement and identify actual RCA. USO/Railtelsites relocation not complete in approved duration due to Indus notprovide RFI as per schedule and few case NSN not deliver service asper requirementFocus Area : Way Forward : Long term visionary approach needs to bedeveloped to handle situations with end-to-end perspective.

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 6 months:The last six months have been quite turbulent for CNC, with severalchanges experimented to streamline and build a postpaid business withstrong fundamentals. Dunning, barring and allocation changes were madeto align with the national recommendations. This had repercussions oncollection and bad debt performance. Amit, drove the change andwithstood the results strongly. While performance in circle as a wholefell, Meerut contributed to the largest fall.Good work done on complaint management on bill delivery and verificationand activation TAT.Remarkable improvement registered on the process audits published byCorporate.Managed transitions in team with long period of vacant positionsreasonably well.Hits V/s Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:- Focused approach on driving CNC KPIs with proper review and correctionbasis learnings- Close liaising with Sales, retail and CS teams to enable high qualityof business performance- Initiated MPesa sales through collection channel- Initiated the handheld roll out with coverage of over 70% of theterritory- Initiatives undertaken to drive operational efficiency, especially onVerification TAT, collection cost and complaint management of BillDelivery- Process correction and improvement on bill delivery- Clean-up of the Green Bill process and streamlined the operations andauditMisses V/s Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:- Collection and Bad Debt were below Target & DB- Telemarketing channel quality issues not fixed despite prescribingsolutions, no close looping done to resolve issue.- Handheld roll out and closure for actual use of the equipment notcompletedHits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Amit led the change in partnering with the Customer services team tounderstand and work on the bill delivery complaints. A completeprocess was set up to review and act on complaints which helped firstto reduce the pace of increase in complaints and then reduce it firsttime in October.Again, on the verification TAT, Amit led his team to develop and trackverification TAT through reporting and MIS and action basis defaultingagency/region/channel. Developed financial model to reward/penalizeverification with prescribed TAT. This led to improvement of TAT byover 9 hours from Apr. complaints.Amit has worked on the collection cost front effectively through channelpayout restructure, allocation monitoring and bucket wise performancemonitoring.Mpesa was another area which was ventured into under Amit's leadership.At the initial phase the results are slow but the intent on thisbusiness line is appreciable.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):- Collection achievement of 97.92% V/s Target of 98.06%; majorlyimpacted by Meerut Zone and TM channel. While the problem wasdiagnosed, implementation and close looping of the correctives was notdone on time. Similarly, the Meerut zone performance could have beenbettered through handholding and close monitoring by the circle teamconsidering that the meerut resource was not able to influence theresults.- Bad Debt again was a miss - 2.06% V/s Target of 1.9%. This again waspredominantly contributed by the Meerut Zone. Knowing this weakness,the circle team should have aligned resources/management time tohandhold this territory till resource replacement. This would havehelped reduce the Bad debt burden on PNL- Certain areas identified for action took time for implementation -TMsecurity deposit re-introduction/close loop quality issue and revert toSD. This would have helped improve bad debt of this channelSpecific Focus on Way Forward:- Collection performance must be improved and get back on track onperformance and national score card- Develop and review MIS to enable business health for early diagnosticsand correctives, especially with respect to acquisition quality and 4-6month decay- MPesa is a good solution to rural postpaid expansion. Need to work onconcrete action plan for execution of MPesa penetration amongstpostpaid customers- Agencies to be identified to segregate different buckets to differentagencies. Currently, that is a huge risk that the circle carries- End to End loyalty programs to be developed along with marketing toenable retention of our customer base with good payment history."

CS, G&A & CNCstill pending.- Closure of Old pending disputes with Indus.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):- Alok's experience has enabled him to add quality value to the accountssystem. The revenue and accruals have been reviewed and suitablecorrective action taken to align with the Vodafone Revenue accountingpolicy. Similarly, the accruals have been reviewed and suitable actionimplemented for proper provision for spends and periodic review andreversal, especially in the NW cost area.- Good inter and intra function coordination have enabled a renewedenergy in team with focus on quality of financials and value tobusiness- Value addition to business through understanding and reviewing SACschemes and analyzing its efficacy, thereby assuring cost efficiency- People changes and transition in team done, with every team memberhandling their respective role for less than two years.

There have been a lot ofgaps across processes which need more understanding and action planningto improve. Key to improvement of scores is close collaboration withthe SCM team as this is where the major weightage is.- CWIP reconciliation with Warehouse has been a miss and has not beenclosed despite several follow ups and meetings. This is an area ofrisk and potential misstatement if there is material issue in thereconciliation. Need to focus and close immediately.- SSK differences and closure of differences in books after duereconciliation. This again is an area which has taken inordinate timefor closure. This is pending since FY14Specific areas of Focus for way forward:- FAR reconciliation and review and entire governance on Fixed Assets- SSK & Postpaid billing monitoring and daily reconciliation to hedgerisks/avoid leakage- Value addition to business on the cost front through benchmarking andreporting to respective stakeholders- Work on soft skills - communication to the point."
"Vodafone stores have shown a remarkable growth in business deliverables,Abhinav is driving productivites at stores, he has been a great supportfor the store and zonal teamsHits: Data from stores has been a good story with YOY growth of 162%,attach rate on new postpaid acquisition has seen a steady growth from33% to 52%. This was done by increasing contribution of data comboplans, more focus and drive on dongle sales and daily trackingmechanism. YOY Postpaid growth @ 29% is commendable. Footrpintexpansion of stores has been done as per the plan- locations of thestores are best in class and have started giving consistent businessevery month, one store has been relocated as per the plan- 100% CAPEXhas been utilized. First time resolution (FTR) is amongst the bestnationally, Associate engagement being one of the priority area EARNYOUR STARS was launched to reward high performing associates. Careerdevelopments of store supervisors has been undertaken with priority-four SMs were given role change to VMS lead- this was done inparticipation with HR thru Retail Parivartan program, it has alsoreassured the team about theie future growth in the organizationMisses: Postpaid QOA should remain a focus area going forward,performance of stores is below par- Moradabad, Muzaffarnagar, Hapur,Station road and Stadium road. Contribution of RED plan @ 10% is lower.Store profitablity is inconsistent- 10 of the existing stores areprofitable as against the plan of 17, EQ scores are amongst bottomnationally, documentation @ stores needs immediate improvement- Mpesadocument rejection, SIMEX forms should be monitored by ensuring arobust governance process. Associate level tracking of sales and itsquality should have helped in doing timely correction, engaging andcoordinating with training and qulaity team and timely interventionwould have helped in improving EQ scores. Store profitablity could havebeen more consistent by improving associate level productivity,effective use of tools like chordiant, hi-fliers and data opportunityloss tracker.Way Forward: Abhinav should drive low performing stores and tgt theirperformance at circle benchmark, this would be critical for overallcontinued success of stores. Abhinav should continue to engage morewith the zonal teams by increasing frequency of visits at stores tounderstand on ground challenges. HSW SMT visits sould be part ofmonthly visits. RED contribution will remain a focus area, immediatetask will be to take every store to 15% in the 1st qtr and upto 20% inqtr-2; driving store team thru catchment area activities for RED, datadongles, Mpesa should be part of initiatives in collaboration with themarketing team. Retail TNPS is key priority for the circle- Abhinavmust collborate with cross functional teams and engage at store levelto improve scores by 30% over Mar'15 baseline. Chordiant/Hiflier toolsshould be used effectively to drive incremental revenue- regulartracking of these facilitators will help a lot in driving revenue fromstores and also engaging associates.Under the spring expansion projecttwo new stores have been earmarked for next FY, these two stores shouldbe operational by the end of 1st qtr- Abhinav will play a critical rolein identifying best locations and cross functional coordination forseamless execution of the entire projet Three important prioritiesgoing forward will be HEALTHY AND PROFITABLE STORES, UNMATCHED CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE & PEOPLE.

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Biswajit has improved as PFM head, as compared to last year, and takesgreater ownership of agenda driven by his function. His bond with teamis good and connects with the business. He has been able to get dueimportance for the facilities management as function form major stakeholders of circle. Certain important projects and deliverablesimpacting business in the circle have also helped him achieving thesame.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Biswajit has done well this year creating the new office in the openoffice culture and getting the office LEED gold certified. He hasfinally rolled out IFM which has been implemented across circle.Shifting of entire circle office to the new premise was handled veryefficiently and seamlessly bringing delight to all employees.There has been good effort in looking at overall cost and optimising thesame. UPW is one of the circles that has rolled out travel with ThomasCook the centralized service partner. However he should guide his teamto work more on opportunities to leverage the travel MIS available,sharing travel statistics with the business verticals highlightingopportunities of missed savings & better travel planning.There has been good efforts in connecting with the zones andunderstanding the issues/needs which helped in quickly respond to theneeds.There has been good improvement in quality of food and offering incafeteria leading to employee satisfaction. He need to be on constantvigil on both quality and health & hygiene of cafeteria as it hastendency of sliding down.Biswajit has picked up speed in adherence of safety passport issuance,KRCC compliance, incidence investigation in circle and closing the CMMcases by engaging with concerned managers. This has helped in bringingabout seriousness about the issue.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:IFM has been rolled out thought not completely as electromechanical isyet to go under IFM. Biswajit needs to work on details, this would havehelped deliver the office project in time and within budget closing allthe snags quickly. He must take quick decisions and influence thebusiness on property strategy eg. whether the circle requires a GH ornot is something should have been closed much earlier and it shouldhave been in existence by now.Zonal office revamp projects could have been closed better and on time.There were lots of loose ends left open which cost us time and givingup of capex which could have been avoided. Zonal open houses shouldhave been done in all zones and ideally in all branches to create widerconnect.Non recovery of security deposit with landlord of old circle office willbe a big miss.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Has taken onus of spear heading safety agenda in the circle. Takenserious efforts in bringing together cross function team around him todrive focus on safety. His involvement with employees on case to casebasis has helped in driving the safety agenda in the circleHas been able to galvanise his team well and have been able to demandwork considerably better than previous years.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):He is encouraged to be more receptive to new ideas, participate in teammeetings & be a part of the various national initiatives in travel,security etc. Stake holder management needs to improve to smoothen theachievement of targets.While handling projects Biswajit need to depend more on modern projectmanagement tools such as Gant and pert charts etc to force the partnersto deliver within timeline with desired quality and cost and less onverbal agreements and personal commitments.Specific Focus on Way Forward:With the focus on cost efficiencies this year we would definitely wantBiswajit to focus on reducing the G&A costs - facilities, security,utilities & travel sharing best practices and looking for opportunitiesto begin down the cost.Progress on Development Goals:Biswajit has been operating with the premise of providing service to thecustomers and has been able to build good equity with them. However, heto continue to building equity with the Vertical Heads across functionsand they need to see him as more forthcoming in acceptance of newideas.Best Practices of other circles on effective Business Partnering has notcome up very clearly as a theme during the year. He needs to takeadvantage of already existing and proven best practices.Progress on Career Aspirations:Handling bigger role & bigger challeges - Biswajit has taken up bigproject such as circle office & Agra MSc+Zonal office and has beenthickly involved in the same. Further he needs to implement modernproject management methods to handle it more professionally."
"APD14-15Overall Performance :Vivek has done an outstanding job in strengthening and managing thetransmission network for both fiber and Microwave nodes. Because of thefocus and efforts done by Vivek through strong governance withpartners, major improvement in the fiber network is achieved. Vivekworked with the business alignment by enhancing the capacity and uptime(with the focused provisioning of resilience transmission links). Firstcircle to deliver nation prestigious project - VTH and also become thefirst to complete 100+ Huawei nodes in North circles.What : HitsUPwest become the first circle to complete the VTH rollout due toVivek's efforts. This was the project of national importance and Vivekdelivered it with style. He build the future proof Transmissionresilience through 100+ km of OFC rollout, creation of 90 POP's,captive connectivity to our stores through project spider, 1200+ MWlinks, 1800+ E1 links and 450+ enterprise links. He built upredundancy by provisioning traffic via multiple paths for BSC. This ledto improvement of RNA from 99.48 to 99.80. Top 10 city protectionenhanced to 84.3% and DWDM faults reduced to 2. He also clocked thelowest aver fiber cuts at 6.5/1000 km sin a month of Feb. He enabledthe CCNA certification for grooming the IP capability in the circle.What : MissesProgress on Old ROW cases. Slow progress in provisioning balance E1's.stability of OFC network, escalations and attrition.How: Hits :Advance planning and farsightedness is the Vivek biggest strength and hemade thorough use of it. Advance survey of OFC routes before awardingthe PO resulted in speedy rollout. He held a tight grip on allactivities like BOQ, Planning, RFAI booking, RFAI clearance, materialmanagement, dispatch, execution, power tapping, visibility, E2E testingwithin given timelines by closed coordination with all teams involve inproject. As most of the rollout happened in hills and not much ofpresence of OFC was available there, re-engineering was conducted whichensure the timely delivery as well as resiliency. Vivek is passionateand demonstrates energy in his work and works across functions. He alsodemonstrated Ambition and competitiveness by his ""can-do"" attitude byworking against all odds in taking the circle FLDS ranking to Gold.Vivek is also a hard task master and drives team for delivery whilementoring them to achieve the defined targets.How: Misses :Rollout of Huawei got delayed due to custom issue and hamper theprogress. Regularization of OFC cases is missed from a priority items.Cuts due to volume of development in highway put pressure of system andhave resulted in escalation from partners and customers.Focus Area : Way Forward :Stability in OFC is needed to be prime focus along with multifoldincrease in expansion and capacity building. Team mentorship need to bethe focus area with an in-depth involvement in their development. Crossfunctional working and cohesiveness is another area which needs to befurther sharpened to achieve overall improvement in the networkquality.MYPD 14-15What Hit - Vivek has very efficiently driven the projectsplanned in H1. Be it a VTH project which was very prestigious fromnation point of view or project spider which has huge impact fromcustomers experience in our stores. Fiber rollout, creation of POP's,deployment of IP radios and Huawei is running on scheduled and beingdelivered with rigour. KPI's are on improvement trend with cuts/1000Km@ 10(improved by 4), RNA@99.60( 99.48), protection in Top10 1.3%.The transmission cost is reduced by converting 10 VSAT links tomicrowave and helping in strengthening network cost. He also broughtUPw to be the first circle in north to migration 100+ nodes on HuaweiOSN.As part of mentoring, he took the initiative to make his team ready forfuture technologies and initiated 1st training in CCNA for whole Northin our office. He also ensured the HSW compliance on top of teamsagenda.How Hit - The project monitoring is at its best whereVivek keeps in view the business impact and thus mobilize the resourcesin affective manner for execution. He drives his team for focus andresults. He plan well, like in case of OFC, route survey and otherformalities were done much before the approval of budget and helped inintegration before time. He understands business well and thus don'tlet the KPI's loose focus, he reinvent and re-engineers wheneverrequire, much before! when it is require. He understands the impact oftransmission as a building block for reaching the customer at the sametime its impact in circle EBIDTA as thus as soon he was able to buildLOS(line of sight), VSAT becomes history on these 10 links.CCNA training in our office not only gave us the large share, also buildtrust on corporate office for initiative. Zero fatality was ensured byconstant download to 1@riskn. 2 warning letters were issued to vendorswhere they did not comply to HSW norms.What Misses - Traffic migration on ICD is much delayed to thediscomfort of circle operation. CEN integration is also delayed.How Misses - Custom issues in import of ICD material delayed theICD integration which was not bridged.Way forward - We need to come to Gold class soon. OFC cuts alsoneeds to be controlled with the current expansion and development workgoing on in the state and need to brought it below the national averageDevelopment Goal - Handling a backend core function of network,Vivek have less opportunity of direct interaction with leadership andcross functional teams. Thus he will have to make conscious efforts forthese interactions."

While there isgrowth in Postpaid acquisition from VMS productivity has dropped from35 in 1st half of the year to 30 in 2nd half. For new channel partnersa rigrous pre appointment checklist could have been implemented toonboard an effective business partner. Governance on channel review ismissing- this is required to review performance and quick closure offinancialissues.Way Forward: Vipin should conitnue with the same passion and zeal,should take up a special project on turnaround of low performing townslike Agra, Mathura, Moradabad and Bareilly. Data attach rate onpostpaid and data FR on prepaid acquisiiton should be driven at 50%levels. Vipin should also continue engaging with the zonal teams thrufield visits and understand ongorund challenges and take timely action-this will support zones in a long way. SMT visits on HSW withcorrective actions should be part of the agenda. Special project onMpesa at ADVMS will be very closely watched. Vipin has many ideas andshould now execute to make these national best practices. all new VMSshould have 90 days productivity plan to bring them at par with thecircle average- this should cover promotional activities, incentivepenetration of associates, tracking earning and ROI of channelpartners. Postpaid productivity enhancement will be key to achievinggrowth in acquisition."

Vodafone exited the year as No 1 inNPS with a wide gap with the second operator. This turnaround from No 3position exit last year has been a result of consistent ongroundactivity, key focus in improving trade visibility and engaging withcross functional teams to ensure that Vodafone scores high on allparametersRetail visibility through signage, flange and skirtings drive and use ofinnovative as well as additional visibility elements has renderedamplified on ground brand visibility.Widest 3G network campaign was a well thought out, complete 360 degreecampaign across all consumer touchpoints. It created cleardifferentiation for Vodafone 3G and ensured that 3G data growth took anexponential turnThough activities on M-Pesa were done throughout the year, nosignificant business results due to marcom activities/initiativesresulted. Clearly it has been a fail point.Off-roll ZME development as competent marcom professionals has beenconcern area..Though support activities to Retail Team were extended, there was aclear lack of involvement in conceptualising and executing retailsupport programmes.Speed to market was exemplified by the quick installation of over 10Ksignages 20K+ Flanges & Sunpacks. 3G segmented campaigns and sachetpack strategy were successful due to lightening speed implementation ofvisibility elements.Network Certification Programme carried successfully across branchtowns is clearly reflective of Ritu's ability to engage crossfunctional stakeholders to a common goal and ensure a seamlessexecution.Use of innovative elements like HIPS stick on flange, skirtings,sunpacks for product communication and flouroscent retail pin-ups notonly resulted in high visibility but also helped saving cost whichenabled a larger coverage of outlets ..Ritu worked consistently on process improvement which resulted in costsavings on both material production and logistics as well led to betterplanning of merchandiser allocation and beat planning.Basis consumer insights and retailer VOC the product reckoner look andfeel was realigned and the data product reckoner was introduced whichhave been well appreciated by the field teams , trade and consumers.The successful widest 3G network campaign was a result of meticulousplanning, taking relevant field inputs, managing work effectivelyacross her team members and ensuring speed to market.External & internal events like Northstar , Zonathon have beenexecuted flawlessly in FY 14-15 & with innovative thematic adaptionsshow casing Ritu's ability to think out of the box & be creative inapproach.Holistic product understanding is still a week area and needs individualself initiative to ensure a more thorough understanding. A betterunderstanding of business issues, priority areas is critical for theMarcom Team as a whole to contribute better to the overall businessHigher ground level l engagement would have resulted in better efficacyof on ground activities and other such initiatives. Ritu shouldincrease his interaction with sales, BMs, ZMs and even CS to ensurethat practical on ground realities & different perspectives are builtinto his execution strategy. This will enable a more close-knittedcloselooping of activities.Ritu needs to increase his involvement in retail market activationactivities and programmes. Retail deserves and should be a given ahigher share of time and effort from her side especially with Postpaidbecoming an important cornerstone of the Circle's strategy in FY15.M-pesa was the Big Bet for FY 15. M-Pesa needed a higher degree ofinnovative input to get differentiated. Regular set of activitiescannot impart impact for a service still in incubation stage. Out ofthe box thinking, more consistent activities could have led to bettercampaign management for Mpesa promotions.As a way forward Ritu should enhance her product knowledge to enable amore thorough implementation of activities while driving product ledpromos/initiatives/onground activitiesTeam management would require a constant working on to enable the teamto perform better as a cohesive unit. Needs to work upon buildingcompetencies to handle team more effectively, especially the off-rollZMEs.Market visits have to be increased to have a better understanding of thepulse of the marketShould involve more and initiate more market sensing activities toprovide onground feedback mechanism to the product team.As a brand professional he should develop the patience and wisdom ofunderstanding perspectives.Would recommend a training on the following 2 areas:1) Effective team management2) Managing in chaos"
"Overall Performance : Rajeev executed the OFC Rollout and rectificationand also managed the fiber O&M. He worked towards building a betterfiber transmission network with cuts < 5 cuts per 1000 Km andcorrection on 100G/ICD Losses. His overall performance has been Good,though he needs to get involved deeper in the fiber operations and gethold of all aspects like ABDs, Tools etc so as to take the operationsto the expected level. Rajeev also needs to work towards enhancing hisvendor management skills so as to get success from the managedpartners.What : Hits Vs Target : 470 Km fiber was put up alongwith connectivityat 74 nodes against the target of 92. By rectification and handlingfiber O&M, cuts / 1000 has reduced to 6.5(Jan 14), against the targetof 5. Fiber touch points have gone up at 400What : Misses Vs Target : Some of the OFC routes got delayed whichcould have been completed by now. Further and OFC cut target was notmet, there have been some deviations in the Planning / Route Surveyleading to more time required to make the routes live for traffic.Rectification could have been more which could have led to better fiberQuality and cuts. RSL issues and 100G/ICD losses were not closedHow: Hits : With the ground work done by Rajeev, it became possible toimprove the transmission NQI by bringing in stability in fibernetwork. Regular follow up with vendors and partners make this roll outand increment in Fiber POPs.How: Misses : Rajeev needs to pursue the long term targets instead ofgoing in for short term gains. Fiber is a long term asset and needs tobe planned and implemented with a long term view in mind. Further,fiber layout being a costly and time-consuming effort, speed ofexecution needs to be focussed to get the desired results.Focus Area : Way Forward : Better Planning and a deeper Processoriented approach needs to be built for the year ahead. Leadershipskills need to be honed so as to bring in the end-to-end ownership forthe function. Team mentorship need to be the focus area with anin-depth involvement in their development. Vendor Management &Communication skills need to be sharpened for effective handling ofinteractions with various stakeholders."

MRP growth ladderingneeds a much more focussed approach.Needs to do market visits to have an in depth understanding ofcustomer and retailer requirements.Consumer insighting needs to be more structured to identify key trendsand consumer behaviours.Should get more involved in Postpaid business and work towardslaunching innovative programmes for driving postpaid revenue andretentionCross functional engagement with CS and Finance needs to be workedupon and efforts made at an individual level to take these functionsalong as partners. Need to guide various functions so that we get rightinsights, correct measures for market trends and better understandingof our consumer base.Market Visits is critical to get a higher engagement with the salesand retail functions.More involvement in operations to be driven through high involvementin key Projects like UK Hills, Urban Drive, LUT.Training on Managerial and Leadership aspect to be planned whichwould help him improve & grow as a People manager"

All ofthis despite from marketing background and handling one of wide spreadbranch in terms of geography.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:In most the KPIs she has fared well be it in Primary target achievement,Infra KPIs, DSOs, DAOs, Data tertiary, prepaid subscriber baseaddition, mpesa tertiary, UTA, CYN etc.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Lots of work needs to be done on MNP, 3G acquisitions, Increasingcontribution of Higher FR to total activations (though Dehradun branchperformance is so far the best in circle), increasing gas share in 1Lac plus towns, increasing DPL in LUT clusters, infrastructure build upin Hills besides achieving Mpesa customer RTT targets in spread monthon month.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Success story in most of the KPIs was scripted in H1 by workingeffectively on the fundamentals of distribution i.e. by increasingchannel foot prints to counter the growing reach of competition and byensuring channels maintaining sufficient Etop and paper stock forproper servicing of beats on regular basis. Effective implementation ofCYN program & retailer segmentation (P&G outlets) has helped the branchin acquiring quality customers as a result of which Dehradun branchadded more customers to the subs base than competition which alsofacilitated the branch to dislodge Airtel from No. 2 position in subsbase in H1.Effective coordination between Mpesa, CS and Distribution team hashelped the team to perform relatively better than other branch in KYC,tertiary throughput and UTA.She also has endeavoured hard in implementing the tenets of HSW acrossall her team members and channel partners.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):First half of H1 had gone in channel expansion and territory realignmentresulting into change in priorities as a result of which few of theKPIs took a beating..Specific Focus on Way Forward:Looking forward to Kavita increasing her focus on 3G & 2G customeracquisition from 1 Lac plus towns, increasing extraction from LUTs andnewly rolled out BTS by improving DPL in line with zone average & allthis is required to get much wanted double digit growth in revenue.She should seize the opportunity of making Mpesa popular in Hills whichwill act as a major differentiator and shall help us in becoming No. 1operator of choice in Hills..Progress on Development Goals:From approach & working style, I would want Kavita to adopt hands onapproach and strong market governance model as same will facilitate herunderstanding on nuances of man management and monitoring of businessteam resp. She should also build more on trade and channel engagementprograms to see Vodafone being perceived as best operator in the branchand the barometer of same would be double digit growth in revenue andTSAT score.Progress on Career Aspirations:Kavita is a dedicated & an efficient resource. Implementation ofstructured, effective and rugged market governance will see performingbetter than H1 AND in growing up the ladder..I wish her the best of performance in H2."

"Shantanu has performed strongly against majority of his KPI's in FY 15.His attention to detail and strong execution has helped the circleachieve VAS & Data revenue targets.Data revenue is at 121 Cr Vs 110 Cr in DB. VAS & SMS revenue is also at100% of DB achievement.Shantanu has ensured a 91% YOY data revenue growth helped partially byan unexpected 3G launch. Apart from 3G, even 2G revenue has grown 57%which is a strong achievement given 3G launch. Data UU's have beengrowing steadily and now stands at approx. 30% of base. 2G & 3G seedingdriven well have contributed to this growth. 3G UU in particular are at45% of HSPA base in Prepaid which is a good story. Data packpenetration is at 46% helped by a successful mass segmentation strategydriven effectively in H2 of FY 15. Pack retention has also been a goodstory in H2 as it has increased from 49% to 65%. 121 approach hasworked well in H2 with data now contributing 12% of overall 121revenues.In Postpaid, the data pack activation on acquisition has beena great story having moved up from 2% to 10% in 12 months.VAS revenueshave delivered on DB. CT revenues in particular have grown by 12% withmultiple interventions done on OBD, IBD etc.Data Segmentation is at a relatively basic level inspite of someinterventions. Bulk of revenue growth is due to mass 3G segmentationcampaigns. More micro segments could have been formed to drive UUgrowth for 2G and 3G. No real segmentation done at geographic level forurban/rural or any separate UK strategy.Shantanu is a reliable and sharp worker. He can be trusted to close anywork assigned to him with efficiency and accuracy. He is customerobsessed and always accounts for impact of any changes on customerexperience. Imbibes the value of simplicity in his interactions. He canclearly articulate his strategy at any forum and gives a persuasiveargument for the same. Has excellent domain knowledge and uses it toderive innovative solutions for campaigns , products etc. He isambitious and is always ready to take on big targets.Speed to market is a challenge occasionally in the data business.Shantanu needs to take his team along on more occasions. Has to developa more collaborative approach which can still enable him to get thebest out of his team.Shantanu needs to take on broader responsibilities within marketing teamin the medium term. Has an extensive experience of data business and hewill benefit from exposure to other verticals as well."
"APD14-15Overall Performance :A great move from working as a backend enabler to customer facingchampion. And what a performance!!!. NPS leadership, which was just adistant dream in past years Ashwani brought it to the focus and in just4 months moved the circle from 3rd to leadership position. Once done heensured a lead of 4~6 points, every month. Under his leadershipnetwork complains have seen the huge reduction of ~67% which not onlybuild the customer experience but also enforced the confidence in thefront line. New MSC project at Agra which is first of its kind inglobal format is just about to be concluded and completing the gigantictask within a year is nothing short of heroic which Ashwani haveachieved. Ashwani worked deeply in sorting out issues by doing deeperlevel analytics and fixing the root cause which also takes him beyondhis allocated work area - like site acquisition, customer complains,commercial cordination. He worked without boundaries to ensure that thecrucial part is never left out. He has been able to build cohesivenessand high engagement within his team and is influential in hisinteractions with various stakeholders. . Overall, an Excellentperformance by Ashwani in the core, packet core and network complaintsarea.What : HitsCircle gained the NPS leadership under his supervision. Once achieved,he did not let it slip and have maintained the lead month after month.Even when the circle of influential is moved from single major town to4 diverse towns, NPS leadership is intact. Customer complains which wasnot directly related to core but was impacting his ranking, he tookheads on. Took direct control and worked on all attributes, minutely.Does the necessary process changes and within 4 short months havereduced it from 20K/month (March14) to 6K/month (in Feb15). 3G had arocky start with failing handovers and drop in customer expectation buthe cracked it very effectively with drive across the geography andbridging the gaps by pushing the ICR partners to implement the changeson the weekend. Switch NQI has become a routine now with almostcent-percent scoring. New MSC in Agra, a project of its kind in Globalformat is just at the verge of completion and have turn out as amasterpiece.What : Misses :Deeper focus required on packet core and ASR. Deep dive in BSNL POI's.Adaption of new technologies.How: Hits :Once he took a challenge of bringing a circle to leadership position, helet no stone un-turn. He focused the efforts of new sites rollouttowards NPS towns and worked along with planning and projects to speedyintegration. He also pushed the modernization in these cities forbetter customer experience and worked along with Brand and CS foraligning the efforts.For reduction of network complaints, strong governance along withanalysis and process flow for better TAT is established. Focus group iscreated for repetitive issues and addressed them effectively. 3G drivewas conducted over the weekend and pushed NOKIA and IDEA/AIRTEL toimplement the handover changes over the weekend and the issue waseffectively control before it could become a major hurdle in ourperception.New MSC is a brilliant piece of work which is just about to be concludedand is a result of minute detailing and supervision. He brought eachissue and held-up to the forefront and solved it on real time basiswhich avoided the cost and time overrun typically associated with suchmammoth projects. He worked cross functionally and with partners andtook accountability for identifying and addressing the underlyingservice issues. Ashwani thinks from the customer's viewpoint inhandling network situations as has come out from various interactionswith him on the product and solution development. He addresses problemswith Speed and by building a trust amongst the relevant stakeholders.Speed in Implementation is demonstrated by quick decisions andaggressive follow-ups with other stakeholders to achieve the stretchedtargets. Ashwani has clarity of Direction and is able to convey thesame in a Simple and effective manner to his team.How: Misses :A deeper focus was required on packet core nodes like SGSN, GGSN anduser experience viewpoint. BSNL POI need deeper analysis. Newtechnologies to be studied and teams needed to be educated for takingadvantages.Focus Area : Way Forward :Vendor Management & Communication skills need to be sharpened foreffective handling of interactions - more so with the seniormanagement. A visionary approach and Tought leadersip is needed to bedemonstrate. Better Planning and a deeper Process oriented approachneeds to be built for the year ahead."".MYPD :What Hit - Core KPI's are maintained at the remarkably highlevels. PSR, ASR and core availability is at its best and made thehygiene by Ashwani's leadership. NQI at 28-29/30 in last six month isthe testimony of same . But the most significant difference whichAshwani has contributed is on customer complaints and NPS. Complainshave improved by 30% and NPS have come to leadership from distant 3rdin March. MTX of Agra is on schedule though it lagged by a month butwith concrete measures bought back on schedule.How Hit - Core KPI's are kept on strict focus andvariation is analysed and fix immediately, preventive measures aregenerating results. The monitoring is so strong that at time CORE givesthe direction to radio and transmission to analyse the impact andreasons in their respective verticals. Ashwani took the charge ofcomplaints when things were not moving in right direction and resultsare here for everybody to see. He created the process and strongsupport system to attack the complains with rigour. He tracked theactionable and created the cross-functional system to contribute. Insummary he brought back the focus on complain analysis and NPS. MTXAgra when lagged in progress, he brought it on forefront and pushed thesystem to escalate, result we are again back on the timeline.What Misses - we are still away from Gold ranking. KPI's though atthe best level but have variation in terms of consistency.How Misses - Still not able to crack the complains and how othercircles are able to manage it in a better way. KPI's keep falling nowand again but good part is, it is brought back vary fast.Way forward - Consistency.Development Goal - As is his desire we will work on someprogramme for induction in sales"

"Job well done with healthy progress on CSI trends in first 4 months,with consistent increase in SOGA from urban as well as rural markets.Market has responded well in H1 to all schemes & initiatives taken bythe team.Achieved UB targets consistently in the first 4 months & reached everhighest figures for the territory in July. Primary revenue has alsobeen on a growth path. Another major achievement is meeting infratargets month on month, which is a positive turnaround story forDehradun. M-pesa UTA & UAA on track for Selaqui, Vikasnagar & cityoutskirts.Derailed from growth path in Aug & Sep on UB, and corresponding hit inCSI was inevitable. Major miss is m-pesa performance in city markets.Growth in 3G revenue not at par vs competition as well as other areaswithin circle.Sania has been able to leverage on all trade schemes (VKS, monthlyslabs, contests). Consistent engagement with retailers has helped theterritory improve on numbers. Focus has been on training channel in 3Gprocess. Activities on LUT & new site launch have been managed well.Focus on m-pesa primary, secondary, customer RTT & agent balance waslacking. Extraction from smaller retailers is still a challenge, whichis leading to inconsistent performance in UB. CYN requires consistentfocus. Performance on 3G FR sale can certainly be improved upon. Ondistribution front, rural market has to be managed better in both hills& plains in terms of infra expansion & extraction. Need to open moreoutlets in LUT sites as current level of DPL is much below 200.While building on good work in H1, I am confidently looking forward toSania ensuring that her team gets back on growth path & consistentlyimproves on SOGA especially with new sites being launched. Specialfocus is required on m-pesa in city market.Happy to see higher level of inclusivity in working style. Discussionsare now happening on all major points. Need to further spend time inunderstanding IN & network processes.Being more interactive with seniors on work, prioritising right andmaking team members self-dependent will surely add to your skills as aprofessional. As part of MT program, you would get the opportunity towork in other functions as well."
"Vineet has been continuously engaged with customers and tries tounderstand their needs.During the period, Vineet has been able to roll out channel partners andenhance the width of operations of VBS team in the circle. He has beenable to build up desired VBS for VMS. While the build up for channelpartners has happened, capability development and development ofservice infrastructure is lacking, this has resulted in lower channelproductivity and non-qualification of CPs under VEPP. Further in caseof VBS 4 VMS, his lack of collaboration with other verticals resultedin only 3 of the 5 becoming successful.Vineet has not been able to achieve the subscriber and revenue targets.While he has ensured that new accounts are mapped, he has not been ableto engage with and drive his team for achievement of Project Atlasrevenue targets.He lacks the ambition to succeed and sets himself targets lower thanexpectation. He fails to engage with his team which results in poorexecution on ground resulting in lower numbers. His collaboration withother verticals / functions / zonal teams is much below the desiredlevel, which hampers him to get the VBS agenda driven at the circlelevel.While he has tried to implement Gurukul, his engagement with his team isvery low and he fails to guide them on revenue enhancementopportunities, which in turn results in lesser penetration on SIP.In this role, he needs to improve upon his ability to influence peoplethrough regular engagement and ensure that he works in collaborationwith other verticals so as to achieve his DB targets."
"APD:Sadashiv has lead his team from the front and have identifiedopportunities in the zone and have towards achieving them. His was thefirst zone to be GAS leader.SOGA achievement @ 26% is more than the target which resulted in Revenuegrowth in the zone @ 9% is second highest in the circle. Reduction inLUT sites has been the highest across the circle.. Expansion of VMS inthe zone has been another achievement, which has helped Vodafoneestablish itself in the market. Data contribution has improvedsignificantly in the zone, though it is yet to grow at the levelexpected in bigger city like Agra.This has been possible through Sadashiv's detailed working onidentifying gaps, quickly moving towards filling up the same byappointment of DBs, SDs and MDs. Sadashiv is always focussed on his keyobjectives, and has aligned his team well on the key objectives, whichhas helped in improvement in extraction from both 1 lac plus towns aswell as LUT clusters.Mpesa especially with launch of torrent has not taken off well in thezone. Similarly, looking at the opportunity in the zone, especially inAgra branch, the RG numbers are well below DB. GAS in urban thoughimproved, is well below the expectations and need to quickly move into20%+. At the same time, with leadership branch like Firozabad in thezone, MNP, though it took off in the later part of year, is below theDB. While the zone has growth on SOGA and new channel partners havecome into business, it is yet to witness growth on distribution and alldistribution KPIs are below DB. Postpaid performance was below DB.During the period, major focus was on improving SOGA share and I feel,while Sadadshiv has done the same, equal attention was not given tobalance of the growth drivers and it has resulted in other numbersfalling short of DB. Further lack of stable manpower both indistribution and retail impacted achievement of targets.Sadashiv has spent one year plus in the zone, and has been able to getthe team along, at this juncture he needs to spend more time in zone,establish business which continues to grow on YoY basis. Further, heneed to improve his participation across verticals, in discussions andestablish himself as mature leader.MYPD:Sadashiv has lead his team from the front and have identifiedopportunities in the zone and have towards achieving them.Revenue growth in the zone @ 12% is one of the highest, and this hasbeen possible with sustained effort on improving extraction from themarket, wherein Agra zone has now become the SOGA leader. Improvementin extraction has also helped Sadashiv to reduce the number of LUTsites in a LUT cluster. Expansion of VMS in the zone has been anotherachievement, which has helped Vodafone establish itself in the market.This has been possible through Sadashiv's detailed working onidentifying gaps, quickly moving towards filling up the same byappointment of DBs, SDs and MDs. Sadashiv is always focussed on his keyobjectives, and has aligned his team well on the key objectives, whichhas helped in improvement in extraction from both 1 lac plus towns aswell as LUT clusters.While the zone has grown on YOY on tertiary, data performance in thezone has been below expectations. Mpesa has not taken off well in thezone. Similarly, looking at the opportunity in the zone, especially inAgra branch, the RG numbers are well below DB. At the same time, withleadership branch like Firozabad in the zone, MNP performance is belowthe DB. While the zone has growth on SOGA and new channel partners havecome into business, it is yet to witness growth on distribution and alldistribution KPIs are below DB.During the period, major focus was on improving SOGA share and I feel,while Sadadshiv has done the same, equal attention was not given tobalance of the growth drivers and it has resulted in other numbersfalling short of DB.While Agra zone has improved the numbers, at the same time, it isimportant to focus on key circle initiatives of improving extractionfrom 1 lacs plus towns and LUT sites. These will help the zone tocontinuously improve YOY growth of revenue and help the circle toimprove RMS. Further, Sadshiv needs to put in extra effort on data andmpesa especially 3G which will play a bigger role in revenues infuture. Further at competitive level, Sadashiv need to look at MNP asone area wherein the zone can do much better. While doing so, he needsto work on improving distribution in zone by focussing onmicro-distribution, improve team working on ground by looking at Msmartperformance or DSE working on the ground.Sadashiv has spent one year plus in the zone, and has been able to getthe team along, at this juncture he needs to spend more time in zone,establish business which continues to grow on YoY basis."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Journey started with knowing the Business Priorities of the year. Youand your team has done a very good job in the beginning of the yearitself and then you managed to remain focused on the desired objectivethrough out the year. This actually resulted into bringing Businessback on track.We decided to promote this year as a ""Year of Data"" - reading fromdifferent data points like VOC / Handset Market growth / NPS pointsystems & also from the expected investments. Somehow our dream ofputting ""Paschimbange Data Manei Vodafone"" - this line everywhere wascompleted to some extent. Why ""to some extent"" because of some point oftime it was because of our excellent execution on New Town Launch andalso some point of time due to lack of budget.In addition to this, we started different new processed like ""marketproduct mapping"" - it needs a special mention of the discipline atwhich it has been done week after week in the year. And also wecontinued last year's successful processes like AVI standardizationetc.Also we initiated series of FGDs / researches to gather consumerinsights - which was very well coordinated first within team and thenwith corporate and the agency. But we could not create an awarenessaround it and thus it never resulted into actionables for product /revenue team.This year we had highest SOV and had significant gap with competition -I believe the credit of this solely goes to you and must say ""very goodjob done"".The list of mundane jobs managing budget or handling agencies orhandling vendors or managing zonal team or handling zonal visibilityetc got handled flawlessly.All the above effort resulted into - NPS leadership and AVI in top 5positions in last Quarter.Few Hits need special mention:1. Hits :a. Handling New Town Launchb. Handling ""Project red""c. Managing highest SOVd. Geo Segment wise POSM & special visibility focus on LUT arease. All events & launches2. Misses :a. Should have been more focused on FGDs and then converting them toactionableb. Consistency in NPS and increasing GAP with nearest competitionc.

Last 3 years, inJAS quarter revenue de-grew but this year JAS GSR was more than AMJ.The biggest challenge of the year was low RPM, which was majorly drivenby Market. As a strategy, we worked on High Gross - turning high Grossto Quality Subs - then converting to Daily UU - thus driving MOU. OurMOU growth is highest nationally but it never could compensate the dropin RPM.The Data, growth was majorly driven by the roll-out and then extractionfrom the market to drive payload. Data grew by 87% YOY. The biggestconcern in Data was initially team and then consistency of growth.

It started with journey of conceptualization and thentransferring the thought process to Sales Team.The strategy of market / geo segmentation gave results in terms ofdriving Bonus Cards in 121 route. And the next biggest hit wasdelivered of the year was encashing high-gross opportunity to Daily UUand thus driving MOU growth. Team remained focused in building on lastyear's success. Last year, we noticed BC adoption is the only thingwhich gives MOU elasticity.Thirst point needs special mention is your effort / work on decidingwhere to put the 3G / 2G sites to maximize revenue at lowest possibletime frame.Misses vs. Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Though circle reached 14%+ YOY growth and also gained RMS this year,still we may end up at 97% of DB achievement. And also out of 3quarters of this year, we lost RMS in 2 Quarters. This is majorlybecause of RPM.Data growth was majorly driven by roll-out. At the beginning of theyear, we put strategy of Roll-out and then maximizing extraction frommarket with a common S&M agenda to drive payload growth in the circle.In terms of execution, we executed roll-out in the best possible mannerin the available time frame also we took enough steps to maximizeextraction but there was lack of innovation in terms of Product Design/ Customer Segmentation / bringing freshness in the different R&Rcampaigns.

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Suman has done an overall good job in terms of intensifying the businessin Siliguri Branch. The acquisition intensity has gone up and there hasbeen good progress on data specially on the 3G front. He has been agood task master coupled with relationship skills to manage hisChannels well. He has clarity to a greater extent on his day to dayoperations and is aligned to overall objectives of the company. He is agreat Team person with great cross functional bonding. Has got a goodacceptance among all across the Zone.

BTSwiseworking and able direction to Team has helped him to show theprogression in terms of acquisition.. He has travelled all across andhas been a key influencer on Channel Partners through his knowledge andacumen, by effectively handholding them and motivating them to performbetter. Sensitivity on GAS and CMS across the Channel Points has helpedto gain incremental share. Aggressive drive on3G has helped to gain themomentum and get to the top among all the Branches in the Circle.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Major issue with implementation down the level. Suman needs toimmediately check the execution level. Non-availability of 3G Networkin few parts of West Sikkim and distributor issue have been the keyobstacles in Sikkim. More push and thrust was required in other partsto get the desired level of traffic and revenue. Darjeeling CMS hassuffered badly because of intense Network issue, which has beenescalated to the highest level, still on ground execution has also beenan issue. More structured work on distribution front would have yieldedbetter results, which was a clear cut gap area. Inconsistent focus ondistribution with no adequate tasking at the DAM level is the mainreason for a stagnant performance on distribution. Suman has to startowning up the execution of the same. Endurance with poor performers(ADs mainly) have also not helped MNP has been a clear cut missbecause of inconsistent and irregular drive. Not being able to leveragethe high port out markets. Governance needs to be more robust. PSRGovernance, drive on distribution hygiene has been a poor show. M-Pesadistribution needs to be focussed on, else the struggle would continue.Siliguri is a big Branch and poor implementation of processes is notaffordable. Lack of followup and monitoring on new LUT sites have alsonot helped to drive the desired level of intensity and output fromthese sites. Tolerance with non-performing ADs has only delayed theprocess.Specific Focus on Way Forward:- Clear focus on Incremental RES, T3M GAS, and Quality of acquisition.- More thrust on Top Towns & High ARPU Tehsils to gain 4% & 3% CMSrespectively.- 30% GAS by April and sustain that through quality acquisition and T3Mretention.- Immediate attention and execution on increasing 2G data penetration toget the desired level of growth on overall data.- Explore ways to penetrate devices all across the market place. Properutilization of Data Brigade and identification of right set of outletswould be the key. Channel motivation and sensitivity build up isrequired on an urgent note on the same subject. Clear build up on theSPO Channel.- Immediately identify poor performing ADs, and replace them with betterprospects. Important that Channels take ownership to take the businessforward.

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 1 year:Robust turnaround of prepaid voice business from a 1.4% YoY in Q1 to9.6% YoY in Feb. DB achievement @ 95% in prepaid voice and 87% inpostpaid voice. This has happened due to the focused drive on Daily UUthat has resulted in highest MOU growth nationally. However, we arestill short of RMS target of 33.9%Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:1. Daily UU increment of 7.8 lacs (Feb 14 vs Feb 15) is one of thebiggest hit. Having an average of 62 lac + consistently for 11 monthsis an extremely revenue-friendly minute-stimulating fact that hashappened for the circle.2. RES base has grown by 18.9 lacs YTD Feb against a DB of 6.7 lacs.This has happened because of 7.5 lacs avg gross adds and also becauseof 34.3 lacs win-back. The tri-monthly base refresh and a geo-segmentednuanced stance has helped us achieve the same3. Bonus Card penetration of 30%+ month on month with Feb @ 38% hashelped stimulate minutes. Clear focus on geo-segmented offers andneed-based interventions has been the hallmark of the base management.Launch of USSD / CRM versions have helped streamline the process evenbetter.4. 121 tertiary has shown a fantastic growth and have touched everhighest figure of 30 crs. Good control on commission has been observedin H2. We should now concentrate upon putting a qualifier on retailerpenetration like 121 > Rs.100Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:1. Prepaid voice revenue @ 95% of DB. Significant drop in Q1 which gotbuilt-up in subsequent quarters. Major challenge has been RPM. Shouldhave explored portfolio revision in bonus card for hardeningopportunities.2. Postpaid voice revenue @ 87% of DB. Postpaid RES adds of 44.7kagainst 55.6k in DB and Postpaid ARPU of Rs.426 against Rs. 456 in DBhas led to the shortfall.3. HVC+ subs & revenue contribution has been lower than targeted. Subs @19.4% vs 22.5% target and revenue @ 59.1% vs 63.9% target. This is dueto lack of structured program to winback HVC+ droppers & upgrade subsshowing HVC+ traits in certain surrogates like DOU, high IC, etc. Needto quickly place detailed program with accountability to one person.4. Prepaid churn @ 4.2% vs 3.4% in DB and Postpaid churn @ 3.34% vs2.34% in DB. Major concern area. Regular implementation of Prepaid CPMto reduce churn is required as 37% of revenue leakage is happening fromtop decile.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):1. Your involvement with your sub-ordinates to groom them hands-on iscommendable. This denotes their trust & admiration for you.2. Ownership in your work and the intent for completing the same on timeare two of your strong aspects. This allows you to increaseefficiencies and bring speed to the overall decision making.3. Analytical skill is another strength which needs special mention.Hone it and couple it with external factors to visualize the full storyMisses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):1. Intent to get on top of postpaid operations is missing. This is acritical skill set required in higher roles. Required to be involvedwith the postpaid channel team for business development.2. Best of ideas can fail if not implemented well. And hence it isrequired to interact frequently with the sales on-field team tosupport the revenue plan.3. Develop the skill for strategic inputs & interventions which do notimpact immediately but has long term implications. This is importantfor long-term business growth.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Daily UU has been one of the strong success story which has to continuein next year too. Laggards like DOU<5 days, weak markets, LVC subs, etcare to be focused for incremental UU. With market forces disallowingany significant RPM hardening opportunity, small ticket items have tobe explored. HVC+ subs become a critical element for maintaining thegrowth tempo. Drive high ARPU programs like RED migrations, high denoBCs & Top Ups, etc to push up the ARPU.Progress on Development Goals:From approach & working style, would like you to spend more time withthe weaker links in your team & free up your time for medium-termplanning & creating sustainable differentiation in the market. Postpaid& m-pesa are clear areas of development."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 4 months:In the 3 months that Shruti has been here, she has tried to develop anunderstanding of an area which she has no prior experience or exposure.She has over a period of time got an understanding of the BOLT systemand is now capable of independently running the system.Shruti was tasked with doing the LRP and even though slow to start withshe managed to get the submissions done by following up with therespective stakeholders and ensuring we were able to make the LRPsubmissions.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Being able to understand the BOLT system along with the ability toextract the information required by various teams for analysis was wellmanaged by Shruti. During the LRP analysis, Shruti was able to chasepeople and ensure that all required data points for completing theanalysis were made available. She also made a master template whichcaptured all line items which were required for the LRP analysis. Thistemplate helped keep a track of all equipment planned for LRP.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Detailed analysis of the budgets not providedCapex Board participation and analysis was missingGroup KPIs are reported every month. Definition of the KPI and theirimportance not yet understoodDetailed insight into what is being done and why is it being donestill missingReports and analysis (like the IO report and budget shortfallanalysis) not published regularlyHits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Shruti tried to keep things simple for the LRP analysis by formulating atemplate which was easy to use and understand by all relevantstakeholders. This showcased the Vodafone value of simplicity.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):The biggest Vodafone Way behaviour missing is speed. Any data given toher for analysis takes a huge time to turnaround. For example, GroupKPI reporting requires information collation from stakeholders anduploading in the portal, however this consumes almost entire day forher.Shruti has not shown the appetite to explore new things or try and getinto the depth of the information available. The quality of takinginitiative is missing. There was an opportunity to understand how isCapex for Vodafone structured and what are the driving factors. HoweverShruti wasn't too keen on participating and wasn't a part of majorityof Capex discussionsEnd to end responsibility of tasks is not taken, Unless reminded thereis a possibility of the timeline slipping. We managed to just aboutcomplete the Group DB and LRP submissions in time even though we had anearly start.Shruti needs to understand the problem statement, analyse what needsto be done and then jump into executionApplication of her previous Transmission knowledge to understandTransmission capex hasn't been done so farSpecific Focus on Way Forward:First and foremost, Shruti needs to increase her speed of working.She needs to start owning and taking responsibility for the tasksallocated to herShe also needs to build her relationships with the Central team andthe circle teamsShruti also needs to understand the bigger picture before executing ataskShruti performance for the next 3 months needs to be closely monitored.She is just about meeting the requirements of the role and there is arisk that she might slip with her performance. In case there is nomajor improvement noticed in her performance then her probation mighthave to be extended.Progress on Development Goals:Shruti has mentioned that she wants to develop a deeper understanding ofFinancial concepts. For this she needs to start undertaking some onlinecourses on Finance. Also she needs to develop inter-personal skillswhich can assist her in the long term to execute the task on hand.She can obtain cross function technical domain knowledge by interactingmore people of the Planning team and understanding what they do. Thiswill also help her achieve her own targets for budget optimization.Progress on Career Aspirations:It is too early to comment on career aspirations of Shruti right now."

Shweta comes with a wide experience in HSW and has a good technicaland subject knowledge. She is self-driven and understands the keyissues to the organization well. She has had good interactions with thecircle teams. Her visits to the circles and zone (Mumbai & Vasai) havehelped her gain information of telecom as a business and the key issueson HSW that we face. More circle visits during the protocol audits andincident review would give a clear idea of the circle operations. Thesame has been planned.2.

Shweta as she would be handling important portfolio ofProtocol as well as Need to understand the business perspective as awhole4. It would be helpful if Shweta gets into the details of the processand try to be a mentor to the other junior team members and her domainknowledge should help them gain insights quickly, also Shweta shouldget involved in processes like HnS plan review as she has experience ofthe same.5. Shweta can work on her skills to co-relate issues better so that moreengagement from Corporate function can be achieved. She needs to behave a more detailed view and not a transactional one.6. Review of protocol underway which would enable her to understandoverall perspective of the organization.7. Supported well during the Annual HSW Objectives framework for2015-16.8. Keep eye for detail - ensure first time right so that more time isspent in fruitful execution rather than correction.9. Going forward Shweta need to spend more time in ensuring the qualityof root cause analysis and ensuring that the correct actions are takenfrom the major and Hipo category incidents. She should also utilize hertraining skills and ask the regional managers on how best she can be ofhelp to them.Strengths :-Good Technical skills, domain knowledge, diligent in follow ups, gogetter, committed.Development areasTo attend the Vodafone Way Workshop to ensure she understands theOrganization's way of working and adapt.Visits circles to understand the operating model."

"Previous Manager Feedback :Tapan continues his eye for detail in contract management. His abilityto deep dive in minute aspects is appreciated. However since he hasdone this for a while now, its important he focusses on process toensure the same or similar activity next time is done at faster pace.His honesty , respect for work , commitment is commendable.He however needs to work a bit of discipline on office timings andunderstand deadlines for tasks which is committed and honored. Hisability to commit very aggressive deadlines sometimes causes concernsas he is unable to fathom work that may come parallely.His eye for detailing can make him a QC inspector in various roleswithin company. Something as basic as Food Quality of Canteen tomerchandize to ability to execute large scale work without compromisingon quality.Tapan's eye on Di5 which indeed is the most important KPI for SCM needsto be understood better for him, each contract is an opportunity forDi5 savings, Di5 is a result of great work, due diligence, marketinformation and more, so if we do all the former correctly Di5 is anatural result so focus on the tasks that lead to Di5 than Di5 itself.Finally he needs to work on delegating some key tasks which may bemundane, which may require lot of calculation and coordination with SSCand groom Rakesh (off roll) person to the next level.He is an asset to Vodafone and wherever he goes and if he becomes moretimebound, objective he clearly is ready for the next level.Satya's Feedback :Tapan, i have been working with you closely for the last couple ofmonths and my observation is that you are a good resource. You have afair knowledge of the profile you are handling. You are good atobserving nitigrities of the issues and put your things forward. Yourenthusiasm is too good.As discussed, you need to focus on taking responsibilties independently,learn decision making skills, face people and learn interpersonalskills and deliver the results independently.This year, i will personally focus to turn you as a professional who candeliver things independently. The journey has begun by freeing up sometime for you to think and deliver instead of working under pressure allthe time.Wish you all the best !!!"

Monthly SME Audit Reports not being shared with the Circles. Noreports shared for 3 quarters now.3. Circle visits not happening as per plan of 2 Circles per month. Thiswill give much needed insights on the operations at these circles.4. While Churn is at par with DB, clear action plans needs to be chalkedout for Segment specific action plans. Clear Action Plans andvisibility is missing in this area, which is of utmost importance forthe VBS business.5. On QOI, while the scores have improved, the action planning withcircles and at a process level has not happened. The details of QOIneed to be sent across to circles for action planning and close loopingwith the customers.6. The drive for ESS and My Vodafone App for SME was not there asdesired. We had agreed that we will initiate the same for MediumEnterprise Accounts and improve upon the penetration.7. Visibility and Alignment to the Segment needs improvement.

He owns the CustomerExperience for his segment and that is something which needs to beworked upon. This role requires him to be sharp at multi-tasking and heneeds to exhibit so as to ensure he is able to value add to thesegment. End to end stitching and linkage of the entire Customer Lifecycle aspects, VOC and VOB is something that he needs to be on top sothat he can add value to the segment and business. All of these willneed to be coupled with the Circle Visits which is of prime importance,so as to enable him to be closer to the customer and circles.Specific Focus on Way Forward:1. The largest area on priority would be the rollout of the Revised SMEService Model. This needs to be executed seamlessly across circles asper the approved plan.2. With the large opportunity that exists on the SME space, Naser shouldbe seen as an individual who would spearhead the Customer Servicefunction for the segment and support then with all the requirements.3.

The drive for ESS and My Vodafone App for SME needs to be picked upand actions to be implemented to improve Self Service adoptionAll of these points have been discussed with Naser during the year andduring the MYPD discussion as well. He has the potential to work uponon all of these and excel in his work area.Progress on Development Goals:1. Naser should take up additional responsibility of understanding theFL business and is something that will add value to him as aprofessional.2. Self-Learning as a culture needs to be imbibed.

YTD till feb we are at 69%.4] This year again we didn't manage to touch Csat target. Though therewas movement from 78% which was YTD 2013 to 85% which was YTD 2014.5] Repeat %, which was YTD @23% last year remains the same this yeartoo.6] Partner could not answer more than 1.32L chats in any month inspiteof us having double that volumes to offer.7] Building an ""ownership culture"" on the floor was the biggest miss.8] Basics such as Briefing test compliance or PK test coverage was astruggle.9] While ICIC errors were bought down from 35% in Oct to 23% in Feb, 23%is still VERY HIGH.10] While Chat operations went 24/7 from June 2014 which was a businessrequirement we were never able to manage SL% in the night hours &invariably we would start the day with very low SL's due to this.10] Very few insights shared in terms of slicing and dicing of the data- Tarang you should get more involved in data analysis of the processfrom every angle.How Hits -1] The regular discussion & planning sessions with partner ensured thatoffered volumes were controlled to the extend of the forecastednumbers.2] Regular con calls, discussions & having a robust downtime capturingprocess ensured we could highlight gaps to Talisma & get the sameaddressed thru further developments as required to better operationalefficiencies.3] The ""feedback capturing"" process in Vsearch was run with vigour whichenabled us to capture all the various mismatches.4] Cross functional synergy between training , quality and opts whichresulted in streamlining various processes which we were strugglingwith (PK, Briefing, refreshers) and also in making certain KPI's gohigher.How Misses -1] While we missed out on launching the upsell piece as the focus wasmore on getting the hygiene KPI's in place, in hindsight you shouldhave lead from the front with the partner & made them see the advantagein starting the upsell piece since it was a win win for both.2] Wrt Csat, EQ & repeats, there should have been more off a push eitherto the partner or corporate quality team to ensure rigor is builtaround these KPI. The rigor towards Csat got built around Oct & that'swhen the numbers started moving. Repeats is still stagnant.3] Enabling the leadership to become independent with regards to process& product knowledge - currently the lot is very dependent on us astheir understanding of the process isnt that deep. It's been over 2years now & we need to start moving in that direction where we havecapable SME's within the partner team who are subject matter experts inthe real sense. You needed to work more with them to transfer youindepth knowledge on systems & processes & make them independent.Way Forward - 2015-20162015-2016 will be the 3rd year of Web Chat operations & hence it needsto be looked as a BAU process.Yes, we will spend the first couple of months ramping up operations toreach the 5k-6k daily figure, but maintaining daily KPI's is nowhygiene.What you need to focus on in 2014-2015, Tarang, are the following -1] Need to ensure we meet our upselling targets for 15-16. This is THEBIG ONE.2] Empowering the partner further to enable them to resolve customerqueries faster & better thru trainings, feedbacks, reviews, tools,empowerment grids.3] Pushing & diligently following up with IT & the Talisma team to closeall open development points identified & already shared with them forfurther developing Talisma capabilities.4] Constantly working at identifying process deviations & gaps acrosscircles, which are impacting seamless customer experience will be acritical ongoing activity.5] Constantly working at bettering the synergies between partner /corporate / circles, so that, the process runs smoothly.6] Indepth data analysis to understand why the customer is reaching us &identifying what we can do to better his experience.Tarang you have indepth system & process knowledge which you use in yourcurrent role to the process's advantage.You are quick to understand, make decisions & find solutions, likechallenges, result oriented & can adapt to change well & yourcontribution to getting Web Chat to where it is today has beensubstantial.I would want you to look at working on the below points in the comingyear to add to your strengths -1] While you maintain good cross functional relationships within CS, youneed to capitalize on the same, more, to close things which are stuckquicker.2] You need to follow up on things a little more diligently & push teamsa bit more for quicker closures.3] & if you feel things are still not moving please proactively escalatethem to me4] Need to start slicing & dicing data a little more, so that, we canview & present different data cuts & get deeper insights regarding theprocess.The above will enable us to take the Web Chat process to another levelas compared to other frontline processes within the system & acrosscompetition making it our competitive edge in telecom."

ESS usage adoption has gone upto 30% as of Jan, which is a goodprogress from the earlier 16%.11. LWP for the ASM's has been a good initiative. This was a much neededinitiative towards Converged Service Offering. Out of 88 ASM's, 69 areGreen Level Certified and 19 are undergoing certification. Out of 187Tier 2 Accounts, 166 Accounts are handed over to ASM's and rest will becompleted post remaining ASM's are Green Level certified12.

Also, the amount of involvement and drive that she has shown indriving and rolling out of various initiatives has been very good.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:1. Subscriber Churn and Value Churn has been a miss at an Overall Levelfor both the segments. The visibility and actions are seen missing inworking alongwith these circles to curb churn2. For the Non VF9 Circles, the Service Structure Implementation & CSDashboard is not done completely.3. On ESS penetration and usage, there has been an increase to 30% butthis needs a further drive in the next 2 months so as to achieve thetarget of 40% by end of March '15.4. Segment Interlock has happened only once in H1. This needs tractionand a close coordination needs to be in place with the segments so asto be completely aligned to the Segment objectives.5. Health Card for the Top Accounts has been initiated. This needs to beimplemented and continued to give a view of Top Accounts visibility.6. On LWP, there should have been better traction to ensure that all theASM's are trained and certified. Also, they should have started theCustomer Interactions effective Q3 so that the impact is seen7. My Vodafone app penetration is not picked up as it should have been.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Bhakti is a self-driven individual who shows great sense of maturity,attitude, understanding the broad picture and going about ensuring thatthe work is done. Her key areas of strengths are the value additionthat she brings to the table to the circle teams and very good rapportwith the other functions and the circle teams. Bhakti should move tothe next level in terms of adding value to the segment and thefunction.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):With the change in business scenario and the expectations steadilyincreasing, Bhakti should be in a position to multi-task and ensureexecution seamlessly. Alignment to the Segments and to their businessobjective needs should be further improved. That's where they would seeher value addition to their segments. This would enable her to be incomplete control at all times and will enable her to take decisionsbased on Customer Experience and Overall Business. All of these willneed to be coupled with the Circle Visits which is of prime importance,so as to enable us to be closer to the customer and circles.Specific Focus on Way Forward:1. Overall Churn has taken a huge hit and we are far off from theTargets. This needs immediate traction and implementation of actionplans to ensure we do much better and are meeting our targets in H2.2. Rollout of the service structure and Service Dashboard across the NonVF9 circles is high on priority.3. Self Service Usage:a. Increasing the ESS drive so as to reduce overall cost to serve.b. My Vodafone App usage needs focus and drive to enable higher adoptionand usage by customers.This will need to be done by a huge amount of interactions andimplementing various strategies with the circles to increase adoption.4. Regular Monthly Segment interlock is a must so as to ensure we workclosely with them and partner them in their business growth. This willalso create a great amount of visibility for the function5. Top Account Health Card / Dashboard needs to be implemented.6. Capability building for self and for the team across circles is ontop priority. This is on the FL piece, wherein the next level for ASM'sneeds to be planned, defined and implemented.7. A clear service strategy needs to be rolled out in agreement with thesegments.8. The Prime Connect program needs to build traction.9. The PRI configuration and implementation process needs to be createdand rolled out end to end.10. The Network process for HQ & NHQ - needs to be created inconjunction with cross functional teams.11. Rolling out Service Desks guidelines, governance & implementation.12.

She needs to do this now with the C&C heads atthe circles and build a stronger connect with them. She has spent timewith process owners to improve her process knowledge, though it hasimproved it could be even better if she had more time. She needs totake on more business impacting projects with circles to furtherunderstand details. It is also my fault that most business projectsthat were given to her were related to telecalling an area where she isan SME (like RHD Desk, Big Shift, Induction Module revamp ofTele-calling etc).

"At the mid-year, Cliff will have to pick up the pace if he has to showany deliverables by the end of the year.In the key KPI areas for him, there is - so far - nothing to demonstrateand this is an area of enormous concern, as has been discussed with himfor a while now.What has been mentioned as ""will be delivered in Q3"" consists - in anumber of cases - of small deployments of ideas that circles have askedfor.The areas for immediate correction and development are:1) Precise planning of deployments2) Insights approach to data rather than MIS approach3) Speed to follow up - an urgency to achieveAPD:Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Good display of working with teams and across functions. Displayed thediligence that is a hallmark of his working style.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:1) The key Hit on the KRAs is the overall achievement of DB which is ashared KRA for the Content team. The individual contribution to thisachievement is not visible, largely due to all the Misses.2) The only new channel that has been launched in the year is PCA in onecircle only and that too at the behest of the circle marketing team.3) Compliance to a new TRAI regulation regarding 2nd consent on STK wasmanaged but the manner in which compliance was achieved was less thanoptimal.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:1) No new channels were launched in the year.2) Neither were any improvements made to customer experience elements onchannels in order to drive conversion rates and therefore revenue.3) Increase in Age on Service and decrease in churn have not beentracked, leave alone any interventions made to positively influencethese metrics.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Where there is a process or a clearly delineated task or objective,Cliff is able to use his exceptional process oriented style of workingto achieve the end result.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):There have been numerous changes in the Content ecosystem in the pastyear. These changes have demanded a high adaptability for the team atlarge, but specifically for the Content Customer Experience team.Within this team Cliff specifically - who manages more traditionalchannels on Voice and Text - has had to display an inordinate amount ofadaptability to meet with the challenges of the changes. A large numberof the ""Misses"" come from a slower response to changes.Also, with increasing business challenges, it is becoming imperative toconstantly seek customer insights and respond to these by making thenecessary changes, interventions or innovations. Cliff does not seekinsights despite several discussions and interventions and this hashindered his ability to innovate or intervene and take charge.A natural outcome of these two points is a lack of speed in deliveringon targets.Specific Focus on Way Forward:There is an urgent need to change from merely following processes andinstructions to leading change in his area of work.Progress on Development Goals:Cliff's working style needs to change to a take charge one. The roleoffers autonomy that he should exploit for all round development andincreasing his own potential. That is the one sure step towardsprogress.Progress on Career Aspirations:Insights led decision making which will lead to innovation and speed tomarket along with a continued monitoring and tracking (moreinsights) this will help in taking on larger, product oriented roles inthe future."

This becomes bigger an achievement given the fact thatthis was a first ever RPM hardening drive on postpaid and the belief /confidence levels on the same across circles was very low.- Segmented Pack Upsell Model : Pack upsell model is built on a highlevel of analytics and insights. Kunal, not only, created the wholemodel from scratch, but has also been driving complete automationaround it to ensure seamless execution. Also, he has envisioned each &every scenario to ensure right products & hence, optimum extraction.- RED Upsell : Again, driving the circles to set up dedicated upsellingchannel for RED migrations, enforcing discipline to control downgrades,creating adequate visibility across all levels to be able to monitorprogress and therefore, enforce due governance, all this is cleardemonstration of the rigor & passion to deliver, which resulted inachieving what this program has really achieved.MISSES- Base deep dives, by segment - analysis and interventions.- MoU Enhancement InitiativesKunal is an excellent resource with a great understanding of business.His commitment to business, positivity and rigor in driving variousactivities is commendable. His other strength is the strong rapport /connect he has established with circles, and his willingness to extendall support to circle teams, also the ability to always think fromtheir standpoint.

He has also notbeen able to ensure closure of the call management RFP in time andthere was 6 month delay in ensuring closure of the RFP.

Mani Requires a lot offollow up to ensure products and services are on track.Key projects and initiatives require a lot of handholding as Maniopposes a lot of suggestions and feedback that is against the values ofspeed and simplicity. In one specific incident, Mani refused to workwith a partner because he felt that it was not part of health servicesthat he handles and that the product should be handled by another teammember, this continued inspite of multiple discussions and reasoning asto why the product should be handled by him. Weeks later he continueddiscussing this this is reviewing manager as well and was asked to takeup the product by his reviewing manager as well.

Subsequently his performance deteriorated ashe was unable to complete key projects on time and is not able toachieve key goals"

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Sanjeet has worked tirelessly to maintain an excellent workingrelationship and synergy between the corporate team and the operationssupport team at SSC Ahmedabad. This has ensured a collaborative workingculture, which has been effective in facilitating quick decision makingand prompt actionsThe Governance framework in place and periodical Operations review hasensured adequate rigour and oversight of the Fraud managementoperations, from corporate office. This framework provides the abilityto identify and escalate any slippages and potential upcoming futureissues, which need to be addressed in time to avoid becoming a systemicproblem.The SSC processes are well designed an robust enough to ensure theteam is able to confidently detect all/any suspected fraud incident andalso take up additional work like Project Spartan (VCS trafficmonitoring), PRISM analysis (test number analysis), DWH reports(in-depth analysis and net research) and detecting all spurt in trafficcases (due to Wangiri, arbitrage/promo pack abuse etc.)After helping to create a major shift in focus to a more risk basedreview, he has been working towards helping create a strong 'analytics& investigation culture' in the team, which has been progressing well.All this despite having a relatively 'young' team, in terms ofexperience in handling VIL's fraud management operations.The team has shown its true potential in been able to successfullyidentify and analyse the recent highlight cases of SIMBox, Wangiricalls, system misconfiguration and arbitrage and rate abuse cases andresulted in the arrest of the perpetrators and seizure of the suspectedinstruments and helped create immense goodwill and appreciation withthe TERM cell authorities. This has also ensured a strong deterrence inthe market place, which was seen in the results of the FRITS trial(where no VF India SIM cards were being used)He has successfully helped drive the strategic initiatives of the unitand create a 'Future fit' team, which is flexible yet able to identifynew emerging threats successfullyHe has constantly pushed the team to deliver and consistently improveon their results, through his drive and unrelenting rigour. He workedwith the SSC managers on a clear plan to improve the VPS scores for theunit thru engaging the analysts which resulted in the team receiving aVPS score of 93% (against last year's 77%)He has always showed his willingness to step into any role whichrequires his managerial, mentorship or project managerial skills andalso in driving issues to closure, with the concerned circleteams/departments.The SSC team have under his tutelage has now transformed into aconfident and independent team which is capable of handling variedfraud risk related assignments, this has been reflecting in the fraudreview activities now supported for VF Ireland (last year ), VF UK / VKGreece & VF South Africa (current year)Hits vs. Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Fraud Prevention Value (FPV) & Fraud Value Add (FVA) as per the VFGroup guidelines for the 10 months (Apr to Jan'15) was INR 709.6 Mn andthe Total FVA (which includes FPV) was INR 756.5 MnThe team is now able to efficiently detect, track and measure allcases highlighted along with capturing the resulting Fraud PreventionValue (FPV) and Fraud value Add (FVA) figures. This has helped publishthe true savings to the organisation and the value added by the unitThe team has consistently been able to meet expectations of detectingand timely reporting of any abnormal spurt in traffic issues to thecircle using the new ILD report reviews - This has helped circles intaking a timely and educated decision and better response to Wangiriissues, promo pack abuse and margin loss cases.Successfully worked towards re-structuring the team to reduce the workload and help create an opportunity for time to be devoted towardsinvestigations. This has resulted in improved analyses of cases andconcerted efforts to improve in this area. All the staff relatedinitiatives have provided a greatly improved VPS Score of 93% for thecurrent year against last year's 77%.Due to the recent process revisions which require an in-depth CDRanalysis (like in cases of SIMBox, checking with PRISM database,payment track record, handset used etc.) - the team has startedfocusing on in-depth analysis of any suspect cases, thereby providingadditional information that could assist in detecting the actualperpetrators or the source of the problemNo adverse case feedback or escalation received from circles duringthis period.Put down revised and stretched KPI's for the team to help measure theoperations performance and also drive the team to consistently improvetheir performance.Worked to help put in place a robust and world class review mechanismfor VF Carrier Services - Project SPARTAN i.e. setting up the fraudmanagement processes for the VF Carrier Services project - which wouldhelp review and protect VCS revenues. The process level detailing hasbeen appreciated by the VCS stakeholders.Pushed the SSC Business Excellence (BE) team for completing the Time &Motion study of the FM processes and related quality projects which hasprovided an improved picture of the team's staff utilisation (87%).This would provide a framework to track the team's Head Count, staffUtilisation, productivity and efficiency in terms of actual FTE andman-hours required to actually run the operationsSuccessful detection and field actions have resulted in arrests of theperpetrators and seizure of the suspected instruments at multiplelocations and a strong deterrent in the market placeMisses vs. Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Reviewing, refining and phasing out the different MISes generated bythe unitDrive a formal quality project for rule & alarm optimisation, to helpimprove the team's efficiency and productivity and reduce the number ofunproductive alarms (like the P1 alarms) and move towards a higherreal-time review %Timely completion of the initiative and driving the items resultingfrom the review of existing Subscription issues along with the requiredrole to be played by the fraud management teamHits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Sanjeet has tenaciously driven himself and the team to consistentlywork towards improving their operations, the quality of servicedelivery and create efficient processes.He has consistently pushed all stakeholders on delivery of projectdeadlines and tracking critical issues involving IT, network, revenueassuranceWorked with the teams across multiple meetings, VC and conferencecalls and to discuss and arrive at the reporting guidelines which arethe mainstay of the VF Group Monthly reporting. The clear guidelineshave helped the team to prepare and provide the reporting informationin time for review and submission to the Group. The new reportingguidelines help the team to arrive at the Fraud Prevention Value (FPV)& Fraud Value Add (FVA), which are key measures to showing the truevalue of the unitWorked to help provide proper justification to senior management forre-structuring the team and addressing the challenges from the team.Also helped prepare an in-depth process note which captures the keyrequirements from an 'investigation' point of view for any case. Thisis helping the team understand and appreciate the expectations fromthem and helps them to conduct an in-depth analysis of the case (basedon the available information and the guidelines in the note)Actively engaged with the staff and analysts to understand their painareas and actively worked on them thereby improving the workingenvironment and better engagement with the staff. This has rightfullyreflected in the recent high VPS scores of the teamWorked on revising the existing set of KPI's, in consultation with theteam for tracking the SSC operations more effectively and to drivebetter efficiencies in the unit. These stretched KPI's would also pushthe team to ensure they are able to achieve these KPI'sConsistent and regular in scheduling the Monthly Operational reviews,attending circle conference calls and tracking all the discussion areasthru a formal mechanism till logical closure.

Theprocess is well detailed and thorough making the roles andresponsibilities between the teams clear and also clear on the actionswhich need to be taken by the SSC operations unit.The continuous process refinements and improvements have ensured theteam is always ready and able to detect the latest trends in the marketplace. The team was prompt in detecting all the SIMBOXes in our network(even before being highlighted by any competitors) and pushed theCircle Nodal officers across the respective circles to work on takingnecessary regulatory and police action. All these efforts helped theorganisation nab the perpetrators and the illegal equipment used andhas helped create immense goodwill and appreciation with the TERM cellauthorities.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Tends to get into regular day-to-day operations mode only and does notspend enough time in developing strategic areas for improving theteam's efficiency and productivityAt times reluctant to take responsibility and initiative where theexact requirements are not clear and success is not a certainty.

His contributions included:Designing the process flows as well as verbiages for direct channelsPutting together the entire training content with channel levelcustomisationConducting 'Train the trainer' sessions for the pilot circleDesigning infra & number targets across circles considering circlelevel nuancesHandholding circles through the entire launch phase through queryresolution & visits to circles to audit manpower & plug process gapsWeekly conf calls with all circles to review Red performance & chartway aheadPost launch too, Sagar continues to drive Red numbers aggressivelythrough weekly conf calls with circles on productivity & conversions.Sagar's efforts have contributed greatly in building Red volumes frominitial volumes of 4k to 10k numbers over the last 6 months.Sagar's identification of circles needing support on postpaid & hisengagement with them on process standardization, database managementetc have also contributed to the channel now hitting highest evernumbers every month. His efforts on productivity rampup included:Mapping call flows for circles across the country - Highlightedopportunities across various circles in specific legs of call routingto help increase Super CC transfersInstituting cross functional co-ordination in circles to help improveSuper CC transfers. Eg Sagar visited Gujarat & chaired a common meetingwith marketing, sales & CS to close points that impacted calltransfers.Inputs to circles on database management. He has been regularlyengaging with circle sales & marketing teams to bring better scienceinto database management for postpaid outcalling. E.g. Transfers in UPWgrew from 350 to an average of 1200 basis inputs from Sagar.He is now also engaged in designing the postpaid SOP.With the Apple tie-up coming about, Sagar's expertise in deployinginitiatives in his channels once again came to the fore:A keen eye for detail & the ability to think through processes saw himhelp put together a complicated fulfilment mechanism.In record time, Sagar was able to co-ordinate across various functions& put together the process flow for MBOs & direct channels as well asApple controlled gadget stores & premium resellers.He also designed training content for the frontliners & helped deliverthis content to circles.Sagar was nominated as the SPOC for all circles for retailerregistration & customer issues.He has aggressively driven retailer registrations, resolved customerissues & continues to be the one point contact for all circles as wellas corporate functions on this key initiative.Sagar also played a key role in helping push the data business amongstMBOs by enabling drive of MBOs. Sagar started the practice of sendingthe 'potential DSO' list to circles on a monthly basis. This served asclear direction to the circles & was much appreciated as actionabledata. This initiative has helped greatly in fueling the 1.65 lac DSOYTD increaseThough it was not part of his stated KPIs, Sagar's efforts incalculating Strike Force interim results are also praise worthy. Hiscontributions included:.Assigning structure to what was thus far an ad hoc individual drivenactivity prone to errors.Standardizing data input templates to eliminate errors in reportingInterpreting the SF construct to correctly bucketize every role & thencompute relative rankings, thus enabling the publishing of 2 trackersthus far - a first in the history of Strike ForceOver & above these specific initiatives, Sagar has played a key role indelivery of other operational goals as well such as DB guidance, towncoding, target formulation for distribution KPIs etc.Misses (How)CP rightsizing was on the agenda this year. However, could not be drivenwith the rigor expectedMicrocoverage could have been driven betterCould have contributed better in formulating the new segmentationapproach that is currently in progress.Specific focus on way forwardSagar needs to focus on developing understanding of ground levelbusiness realities by engaging with circles more effectively throughmarket visits & conversations with circle distribution teams. He needsto engage with the distribution heads in the circles in driving keyobjectives like retailer segmentation & quality of acquisition.Sagar is in a position where he can much more efficiently leverage hisexposure to both marketing as well as distribution functions when itcomes to ideation & solutioning.MYPD:Sagar possesses a strong understanding of business systems & processes &has shown to himself to be a reliable member of the team. Hisbackground in marketing has helped him to develop a keen understandingof business planning & system acrhitecture.Over the last six months, Sagar has been able to channelize circle teameffort into exceeding expectations on critical parameters like DSO.There is good traction on DSO micro coverage as well. While somecircles are under stress, overall UEO has also been more or less aroundtarget.Like he has pointed out, there is still a lot of work to be done on thecritical piece of retail segmentation.Sagar has also been instrumental in driving key initiatives likeVodafone Red. His visits to circles & also insights into interpretinglead indicators like the Super CC funnel have helped circles likeGujarat improve their numbers.There is still a lot more that can be done to further drive Red as wellas overall postpaid numbers through a systematic disciplined approach.This feedback has been discussed with Sagar & I am confident the willbe able to move things along in H2.Sagar has voiced his ambition to lead a distribution team at a zonallevel. Towards this goal, it is important that he develops anunderstanding on how initiatives are operationalized on ground. Thiscan be achieved through more frequent market visits & hand holding ofcircles struggling on critical aspects like distribution numbers &postpaid productivity.As a first step towards his leadership ambitions, Sagar needs toincreasingly look at his channels as a whole rather than limited to setKPIs. This will build complete ownership & enable him to drive thebusiness at a holistic level.Sagar has verbally voiced his aspiration to take on either a corporatemarketing or a circle distribution profile as his next move. He hasmentioned his ambition to grow into a circle distribution head role aswell."

He believes in working smartly and developscalculators which very handy and useful for the team.Jigar highlighted changes required in the cell split thresholds foroptimizing capex requirement for 2G and 3G networks. He analysed KPI120 and 110, sector add and feature rollout gain to arrive at newrecommendations. He participated in a strategic discussion on spectrumauction Fy15. Jigar suggested changes in the methodology suggested byvendor Phimetrics. This has helped strategy team to accurately forecastrequirement of expansion TRXs and coverage sites to address lose in 900spectrums. Jigar was also quick in closing A over IP BoQs for M & D andTop 2 Towns of Nokia managed circles. This helped MTX team to useavailable capex and achieve deliveries before March 15. Jigar haddeveloped useful calculators for NSEI planning. This was a very goodinitiative in SGSN in pool design. Calculator was used extensively byall 23 circles to accurately plan NSEIs. Good initiative and smart waysof working by Jigar. Jigar had similar initiative on spectrum analysiswork where he worked out a calculator for estimating TRX per sitepossible within given 900 and 1800 MHz spectrum. This was quite handywhile discussing with strategy team and Phimetrics.Jigar to build on the already developed approaches and must takeinitiatives to connect it to a larger picture or goal. Expect Jigar toinitiate more detailed designs in his region. Detailed design forcities like Surat, Ahmd, Baroda and Pune are very critical looking atthe growth these cities are experiencing. Jigar must deploy tools likeArieso for carrying out detailed plans on small cell rollout.

"APD Review Comments:Manvi has demonstrated exemplary product management skills in her role.Going consistently beyond the call of duty in ensuring businesssucceeds, supporting her colleagues, and handling complex assignmentswith aplomb.Her intense focus on VSDM has resulted in launching the best propositionmix, anywhere in the world, for VSDM. She has featured in groupinterlock calls and also download sessions to circle counterparts, andeach time she has garnered very positive feedback.Her ability to handle pressure in the context of GfK analyticsopportunity and intellectual capability to get in to depths isnoticeable. the passion to handle new areas and the drive to achievebusiness revenues is palpable.the business ownership the philosophy of""product manager is a CEO"" was at display as she pursued profitabilitywith a keen discerning eye.The specific focus on VAS ensured over-achievement of revenues and DBand in doing so has established a good operating model.She has been spotted as an outstanding MT and having been nominated forstrikeforce and Heroes photo shoot is a testimony to her contributions.She is at ease in handling all portfolio interlock calls.Her logical time bound conclusion of CX workstream is commendable and inthis exercise she had to ensure alignment of cross-functionalstakeholders and finally an executive sign off.Her contribution to VSDM and VAS deals ensured revenue achievement,though VSDM as a product was an under-achievement.What could have been better:VSDM is currently under-performing. The challenges are due to low focusfrom field teams. This remains an area of reflection and a renewed 360program has been put in place.Manvi could have concluded her VAS efforts in designing a VAS excellencemodel, an operating model to support and drive VAS in all circles.The partner engagement on Mobile App providers is a miss. GfK mAnalyticstook priority but calendarization of such programs would have beenbetter.We have discussed the need for Manvi to do career planning session.MYPD Review Comments:Manvi has demonstrated great passion for her portfolio in focusing onboth revenue management as well as customer experience aspects. Herfocused drive on MCI and CCT has helped steer acquisition numbersupwards. Similarly, her ownership of Adidas customer situationexemplified her customer committment.

Her effective inter-personal relationships on teh floor as wellas with circles has helped her progress in many product development(MTM pilot, VSDM Managed services) and circle interaction (VAS teamscorporate, Circle marketing and circle AM/presales).She interacts with ease with many group counterparts and this is a goodhallmark.What could have been better:VSDM is dying for attention as it is currently under-performing. Thechallenges are due to low focus from field teams. A more rigorousapproach for this product is required in order to ensure top of mindrecall in every sales person. Currently, the corporate led approachesas Spotlight are yielding few results. Manvi needs to step up dedicatedfocus on VSDM.Manvi would excel more if she cuts out a time bound and methodicalproject plan. In work areas such as Managed VSDM, she should haveapproached it with a tight project plan. I have shared this as workarea she must work upon.As a future growth areas, I advise her to work on executive levelpresentation making. Manvi needs to start working at levels above herand not just restrict herself to peer group. Her knowledge on workpiece needs to more effectively translate in to discussions andcontributions; net-net organisation or work stream could gain more whenshe speaks up in large forums.We have discussed the need to do career planning session. I have askedManvi to come back with a date and time and with preparatory work onhow she wishes to shape up her career in Vodafone. She has demonstratedgood VF ways of working and with focus on few improvement areas, shecould be oustanding."

"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Rupinder's contribution to the content vertical's performance this yearis extremely visible and clear. The clarity itself is something that isa result of his work and style of work his ability to isolateinformation and show empirical evidence.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:He has successfully delivered the Music Recommendation Engine and hassupervised the integration of the engine with other key channels. Thisalone has resulted in a 51% YoY growth in activations for one of ourkey services - Callertunes. The revenue contribution also has beensubstantial.He has also designed & successfully piloted Content Campaigns on Flyxtwhich is commendable considering that it no content campaigns are everdone in circles through Chordiant or Flytxt.Rupinder has also done very good work on improving customer experienceand increasing revenue on our wap push promotional mode. This is thesort of interventions - analytics / insights based interventions & thatare beneficial to customers - that are needed.Misses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Due to the intensive nature of the RE roll out, one of the areas offocus improving the Content experience and therefore revenue on the MyVodafone App has been missed.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):Rupinder has an exceptional clarity of thought which is what gives himspeed of execution. He is able to sift out the essential from thenon-essential and focus on those aspects of his work that he knows willhave a greater impact on customer experience as well as on revenue.Along with this, he is driven to perform. His performance is never inspurts, Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the results he is able toachieve drive him to perform better.His performance track record as well as his innate personality gives hima confidence that is visible in interactions with peers as well asseniors.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):The Vodafone live! RE was a critical part of Rupinder's targets (alsohis Manager's!) this year and it was not delivered. However, this isnot a Miss since the delay is completely attributed to IT's deliveryfailures.Along the way next year though, Rupinder will have to give a thought toimproving on multi-tasking so that all areas of responsibility andtargets he carries will deliver superior performance through the year.This year, a little more push on evangelising circles to use Chordiantand VAS for campaigns or on the My Vodafone App would have deliveredsuperior results.Specific Focus on Way Forward:The thrust needs to be on a complete and singular experience on datachannels and applications this year. I am also looking forward toRupinder's work on improving contact policy while ring fencing revenuethrough customer insights.Progress on Development Goals:I see a difference in Rupinder's approach to insights and contentsegmentation from a development goal that had been identified for himduring the MYPD. He definitely takes a more ""creative"" approach towardsunderstanding a set of customers who are represented through a list ofdata inputs, This has helped him designing the Flytxt campaigns aswell.Progress on Career Aspirations:Interact more with the Data Capabilities team & Voice Segments teams tobe prepared to make a move in these product roles as per hisaspirations."

"Saurabh has given a stellar performance in the area of handling allaspects related to the review of Mobile Termination Charges, which is avery important area for Vodafone. From interacting with variousinternal functions, collecting, collating analyzing and validatingdata, to supporting the development of a fully allocated Cost model,submissions to TRAI, answering queries, ensuring presence of relevantpeople to answer on the technical issues raised by TRAI, closelyinteracting with Group, Saurabh has handled this project extremelywell. This was also recognized by TRAI in an open forum, whereChairman, TRAI openly appreciated Vodafone's submissions and held themout as a benchmark for the industry. Saurabh was also extensivelyinvolved with Group in the preparation of a LRIC cost model, which wasnot submitted to TRAI, as Group was not fully confident on the same.The TRAI MTC regulation also fully incorporates all the principlesenunciated by Vodafone - while the final number may not be uptoexpectations, there are some basic errors in the calculations by TRAI.Also the material on record will support in the event of a legalchallenge.Another key area of performance has been on the subject of Green telecomwhere he coordinated with PWC for the preparation of its Report,submissions to DoT, interacting with business, facilitating sitesurveys by vendors, etc. The DoT impractical green telecom targets wereultimately advised to be recalibrated by an Inter-MinisterialCommittee. He has also been mentoring a team member - overseeing thepreparation of internal regulatory PPT and reports while taking apersonal lead for preparation of key presentations requiring researchoverview and insights, including on OTT impact, which was very wellreceived at a TRAI workshop.In his other areas of responsibilities Saurabh performed competently -internal presentations & reports, tracking EMF penalties, otherdisputes & penalties, regulatory litigation updates, etc - ensuringtimely & correct reporting. He has also supported in preparing thefirst cut of a Regulatory Black book which is still work in progress.An area which is a miss is that the Regulatory deep dive into coreissues is an area of development. Also while aware and agile aboutpolitical and other developments, Saurabh does not take this to thenext level. He has the potential to develop, but needs to apply himselfmore. Saurabh did not track his career goals & aspirations in hisself-assessment. On questioning he accepted the need to dive more intoregulatory issues."
"1. General:. Agin is the junior-most of all the Regional InvestigationManagers in terms of corporate experience. But the work done by himthis year has greatly enhanced his learnings and experience by leapsand bounds. I am thankful to him for helping me gradually build a verygood investigations vertical in the southern region.2. Hits: What: Agin has done well to investigate few good cases in thesouth region this year, which had impact. He has also adhered to theInvestigations policy and achieved the Goals on completinginvestigations on time and conducting trainings. He took initiative onProject vault and even guided his team members to take it up. Overallhe has achieved his Goals this year.Examples: The AP circle CAF case, M Pesa brand case.3. Hits : How: Agin has been able to successfully close most of thecases that were referred to him this year. Though there was delay inone or two cases, this was due to certain factors beyond his control.He has been able to develop partnerships within the business; which ispraiseworthy. In one circle, he developed his contacts and almost got acase registered; but that did not end up in giving the desired impact.However, the efforts are appreciable.His way of maintaining the case documents is also appreciable.Examples: He handled the case of AP circle CAF matter with maturity.Given the fact that he is relatively new to the corporate world, he hasdone well to pick the work culture and adapt himself to suit theworking style.In the m pesa case of TN circle, he displayed good synergies by workingwith the Legal team of the circle and successfully interacting with theTechnology security team to protect the interests of the company.More than 60 % of his recommendations have been accepted and closed bythe process owners/business.4. Misses: What: Agin must complete the training in the remainingcircle. While he is the path breaker in Vault, it did not catch up orgain momentum and got to a logical closure. The report writing aspecthas a scope for improvement.5. Misses: How: Agin has somehow not been able to penetrate the Keralacircle and perhaps this is the reason for not doing the training inthat circle. He must work on a proper strategy to develop rapport withfunction heads and penetrate the circle.While Agin has done very good work on the cases, I think the ideas arenot getting fully reflected on paper in a logical and concise way. ThisI am sure will come to him in due course of time; but it is upto him tomake the learning curve faster. At the time of reviewing of the report,adequate guidelines have been given to him on related areas. It is apositive aspect of him that, he has been showing interest and eagernessto improve. In case of Vault, he missed the opportunity to displayleadership by leading all the team for its adoption and closure.Specific focus on way forward: Simplicity and humility are his strengthsand he must continue to spread warmth using this.As for the work, Agin must penetrate the Chennai and Kerala circles andconstantly try to get referrals. He will have to develop good contactsand rapport with function heads in the circles and if required increasethe number of visits rather than only for work purposes.Some more thought on recommendations is also required. Apart from merelystating the gaps he must think on how to make innovativesuggestions/recommendations so that, it leaves adequate long termimpact must be now the area of focus for him. He had given one suchrecommendation of Biometric locks in the stores last year.6. Areas of development and progress on career aspirations: Agin mustfocus on writing more quality reports and generate quality cases in allcircles. At times, he appears to be in-flexible.

The high point has also beenthe Way2Win partnership engagement program, in whichshe led multi-city events in an innovative and bootstrapped model. Shehas shown great interest in product management andcustoemr savviness in the workstream related to Pepsi. For her dedicatedwork on this, she got rightfully recognized byglobal GAM under VGE Shine program. The work on envisioned M2M 2.0 isgoing smoothly and in this she had championed the causein all meetings, making Marketing the masthead for this initiative.She is very comfortable with customer engagement and partner engagementand displays good customer relationship capabilities.The contribution for M2M PR and well recognised BEMS whitepaper aresingle-handed and testimonial to her passion and depth ofunderstanding she has built in her work areas.Naina could focus more on planning and ensuring ball keeps rolling onmultiple fronts. The rate hardening, while it was amuch needed exercise, could have been explored in much more scientificmanner to ensure the impact is delivered. She needs to gear up toperform under revenue pressure work conditions while balancing the longterm roadmap items such as Aadhaar.She has good capability to grow in her capacity and lead largerportfolio of products with greater revenue ambition.MYPD:Naina brings passion to work, especially on M2M and customer engagementaspects. She championed the customer's cause by highlighintg gaps inm2m customer service and helped improved quality of service. Her goodwritten communication skills come to the fore in many aspects -effectively communicating the point, handlign M2M PR requests, whitepapers(2) and stitching presentations at times for m2M LoB(Joy). Her committment was in good display at the m2m telematics eventand in her relentless drive of Delhi circle to repair the situationwith logicLadder customer.

Naina's contribution to Pepsi's workshop and hercontributions to m2M succcess are testimonials of her effectiveness atwork.Naina often runs in to situations in her work which are to do withcross-fucntional interactions. she could do more by attempting tohandle the situation with tact. At times, some work areas aredeprioritised which is an area for her to work on in order to carryconsistency in every planned and at times un planned activities. Herexcellence in execution of m2M ideation; but needed few follow ups whenit came to closure of circulation of winners list. The misses includeleaderboard and partner management updates which needs to be fixedgoing forward.Naina would need to work on her career plan and call for a discussion toset the 6--12-18 months roadmap. Naina's passion and her ability towork seamlessly with circles and customers would be a good asset. Also,her flexibility in handling new work areas- VGE process tracker- willhelp her mould in to a well rounded professional. Her candidness inpointing out issues is an effective skill at work!.

"This year was a mixed bag for Ruchi with extreme highs and lowsHITS: The period from Apr to Nov was a time for growth andconsolidation. The highlight was the compilation, development andproduction of the fourth edition of Vodafone India's annualSustainability Report, Footprints IV - Steps Today for a BetterTomorrow for which she won the MegaSStar Award and the launch of thepartnership with Grow-Trees.com at multiple levels - corporate, circle,internal & externalMISSES: In contrast, the performance from Dec to Feb was below parrequiring multiple interventions on several occasions to ensure thatthe projects/plans do not go off-track. Though she did engage withpotential partners, industry associations and on-going projectimplementers, the fire in the belly, the passion by her own admission,was missing. In fact she was not keen to fill in her APD and had to bepersuaded by self and HR to do so.OTHERS: Ruchi had a discussion with HR and also discussed this in detailwith me during her APD. She attributed her lack of motivation, driveand engagement to questions she had on career opportunities andprogression, the consistently changing paradigm (New Strategy by Group,CSR Law, New EA Head) and availability of finances/resources to buildthe sustainability practice.The detailed discussion has helped bring in clarity to a few of theissues she had, especially regarding scope of the function andavailability of resourcesWe discussed that her to focus should be on building expertise inEducation and Empowerment domains to scout for opportunities where theorganization can make meaningful impact through its Sustainability &CSR playAlso the significance of the new Sustainability Blueprint thatendeavours to change the culture of the organization thus providingopportunities to build partnerships with businesses internally tofacilitate their adoption and adaption of the sustainability agendaDEVELOPMENT AREAS: On the developmental front- needs to be moreself-driven for she has the potential, talent and understanding but asper her own admission, works best under pressure. She needs to investmore in acquiring knowledge especially the CSR law and itstechnicalities, understand the new sustainability agenda and blue printbetter to lead the projects independently.Also, she needs to take end to end ownership of the projects she isleading. Vendors/partners have outstanding long after the project isover. Have advised her to get access herself to relevant systems suchthat she can do the requisite paperwork independentlyWe discussed and agreed that the next 6 months will see Ruchi take on amore active and leading role with challenging assignment and stretchgoals.In my opinion, the inconsistency in performance was a one-off and Ruchiwill bounce back with renewed rigor and enthusiasm."

"The year went good with lot of critical project's taking its shapeduring the year. One of the excellent project that got closed wellwithin delivery timeline was project Sprint on RECC. Mihir has shapedthe charging delivery very well and most of the activities are driventhrough a defined process. He was able to establish a well definedgovernance with project delivery partners which was the key for asuccessful delivery. Mihir was also able to groom the team to handleprojects independently and this is one of the reason, one of the teammember has taken a lead role in packet core implementation. There aresome more fine tuning required for a better operational handover whichwill be the key focus in the coming months.What Hits: Other than most of the projects taking its shape some of thekey deliverables where the Project Sprint for RECC expansion, the SMSRdeliverables, the SPML integration to support CSDB migration etc. It isnot only project deliverables, but the documentation for projecthandling also took its real shape with all KPI's being delivered aspart of the project. Mihir helped in grooming and creating a fanstasticteam of project implementation which was also a key hit.Key achievements of Mihir also included SMSR phase 2 deliverables andshaping the IN modernisation of North setup. The IN is projected to golive by Mar'15 as per agreed timeline. The important aspect of all thisdeliverables also included documentation and proper process handoverwhich clearly measureable through project KPI's. Key achievements alsoincluded going live with online notification across country which wasthe business need for the hour thus improving customer experience. Someof the initiative which was discussed in the later part of the year aretaking the shape which includes regular governance with internal stakeholders which MPLS and SNOC.How: There was a strong governance established with each of the partnersand all stakeholders for a clear deliverables. Very tight cordinationwas the key to successful delivery. Processes were created for aperfect implementation and each of the milestone was defined with astrong KPI which was measured closely. Regular feedback sessions weregiven to his team members which helped in regular course corrections inthe delivery.What Miss: Some of the projects viz SMSR, Project Schnell, DRimplemenation of RECC has largely delayed as per orginal plan. Therewere service issue's in some of the service going live. Employeeengagement and training requires a bit more focus.How: SMSR project from Comviva had various product problems which tooksome time for correction. During the course of this project, there weresome service issue's largely attributed due to product issue. ProjectSchnell for RECC expansion has taken a longer time than expected due tomaterial delivery issue from the partners. There are some area's wherefine tuning is still required for a perfect handover to operationsformally. A strong governance with SNOC for time to time update andfeedback is required.Way forward: Now that the product issue's and material delivery mattersare sorted out, Mihir should try and attempt to bring all the delayedprojects back on track for a closure before this year. He should tryand see that we are able to close all the deliverables for this yearwithin this year. He should have very high focus on Ericsson IN swapproject and see that there is no delay due to any matters. Continue hisfocus on the team and try to make them as independent as possible whileaddressing their concerns. He should be able to bridge the gaps ofoperations handover and have regular sync up meet with SNOC team fortime to time update.Mihirs focus area in the coming days should include to develop a stronglead as his subordinate. He should keep focusing on employee engagementand training to the team members. Though his deliverables do includeclosing all the projects lined in for this year. He will also berequired to allign himself for some of the key migrations planned aspart of Mumbai DC readiness.Development goals: Mihir has been given monthly feedback which will becontinued. Required project management skills are already provided toMihir. He will be given with regular coaching as and when required.Mihir should focus on his employee engagement and team developmentplans. He should also focus on strengthing further the processadherence within project managment.Aspiration: Mihirs feedback on further growth in the organisation hasbeen taken and will be worked upon. He is looking at growing further inhandling big budget projects other than just technical (viz the PMOprojects). His potential assessment is being worked upon to work on hisdevelopment areas and strengthen his key potential's."

Rohit tends toforget about space, power requirements at times that could beshow-stoppers if not handled earlier.Rohit needs to improve on his communication skills quite considerably,since this causes understanding issues while working with a team.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Rohit needs to improve on the following points for his own personal andprofessional development:1. Rohit needs to improve his self-confidence especially while dealingwith cross-functional teams and peer groups.2. Rohit needs to work on the financial aspect of the deliverables thathe works on. Rohit tends to focus entirely on the technical part andnot on the budgeting & costing implications of the deliverables beingprovided.3. Rohit needs to improve his presentation skills considerably.

"Haresh is enthusiastic and he is a person in group who makes thingshappen. He has very well project driving skills. He prioritises andperuses projects important goals. In a project journey he organisesmeets quickly by involving right people and ensures objectives aredelivered on time. He is a good listener and makes necessary behaviourchanges based on feedback. He builds very well on the shared idea.Haresh has very well coordinated LTE RAN planning activity for Bangalorecity. He adopted a much evolved planning approach and looked at variousaspects on planning (360 degree view). Ensured high data consumptionareas, business critical clusters, competition presence andcorporate/enterprises locations are addressed during the planningprocess. LTE model was very well tuned in planning tool by runningvarious iterations for DL/UL speeds, loses and interference levels.Haresh has actively supported activities likes Forecast Analysis, DBAnalysis and long range planning for FY16, 17 and 18. Team adopted avery detailed approach in planning 3G sites. Business forecast wasextrapolated and cell running hotter than guidance threshold wereidentified for cell split. This helped management to accuratelyforecast and fine tune numbers for final global submission. Hareshdelivered LRP activity with responsibility, accountability andcommitment.Haresh needs to closely monitor circle performance from planning pointof view. Circle growth needs to be captured proactively and same mustbe highlighted internally for discussion/finalisation. Delhi circlehad used up entire DB budget for RNC by Jan'15 and rolled out thebudgeted capacity. However most of the RNCs are running close to 70%utilization. As mentor of North, I except Haresh to Raise a RED Flagfor such occurrences well in advance before circle start raising PRs.Expect Haresh to closely work with each of the circle in his region andhighlight concerns every month with solution proposed. Spectrumre-farming, Idea U900 story must be tracked closely. Key analysis onArieso tool for identifying Delhi hotspots/smallcell /sector additionopportunities was a miss. Delhi circle must be ready with alternativeplan looking at late arrival of second carrier. Overall engineeringanalysis needs immediate attention. Some initiatives like CSI and Gridplanning were good however Haresh put fewer efforts to publish iteffectively in the available forums. These were lost in the BAU story.Improve upon central network utilization dashboard, use it effectively,and build on it/make it more informative. Discuss pain areas of each ofthe network with supporting data points and action plan. Need todemonstrate drive at circle level with the ambition of best utilizationlevels on planning. Expect him to regularly track/focus on featuresrolled out and clearly highlight its benefits (gain) observed in thenetwork performance.Haresh has good potential to grow. Apply smart and bright ways toanalyse networks, demonstrate curiosity by initiating experiments inthe field. Read new ways to plan networks and bring in outside views,fresh ideas to make circle performance improve. Help others to succeed."

"Overall Appreciation for performanceMy feedback from the 6 monthly review and probation confirmation haschanged a bit more. After her confirmation, Srishti has shown'individual' promise and has been a good individual contributor. Withher team, her performance has improved further as I have monitored thisfor the last 3-4 months, and will be keen to see how it progressesfurther. Following protocol has become better. However, there is stilla lot to be desired in her interactions with the team and her teammanagement skills.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:Some good work has happened on planning Tee walk, EWC and towards CeBIT.Delivery on Ready Business has by and large been good but has been arollercoaster ride.

Due to MPYD not done, some hard decisions could not betaken against a team member.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Recruiting the right team resources ASAP. There has been considerabledelay already.Having operational intensity and attention to detail.Focusing on priorities, and not letting any action item fall off theradar.Being a better team manager.Focus on closure.Progress on Development Goals:Personal engagement is very good.Focus required on team management.

He has untiring attitude -ready to invest time and energy till he gets best outcome. Alpesh is agood team player. He works positively towards meeting the overall goalof the assignment.Alpesh has proactively engaged through all the critical stages of DBanalysis and guidance formulisation. He has analysed BOLT submissionand reviewed circle ask wrt central guidance. His has identified overestimation of circle demand through network KPI analysis like 110, 120and BSC, RNC utilization dashboards. Alpesh has supported guidanceactivity with analysis of network using smart tools like Arieso andTouchpoint. List DC HSPA handsets per circle analysis was usefulinformation for finalising U900 guidance for Mumbai.Alpesh swiftly managed WiFi handover from Products team. Basis hisknowledge he was quick to add useful dashboards for monthly performanceanalysis and reporting. Some other good initiatives where Alpesh isdoing well - RNC traffic modelling for Ericsson circles and rolling outCRAN concept in Orissa.Present engagement with circles is on a case to case basis. Circlesdemand for capex leads to analysis and BoQ finalisation. I would liketo see Alpesh being ahead of the curve. This will be possible throughregular reviews with circle planning SPOCs and identifying key painareas impacting planning processes. This exercise will also list ofBoQs which needs to be closed on priority plus opportunity toexperiment new ideas/optimization/products. Analysis of 120c was one ofsuch opportunity which could have helped 3G circles to optimize HSlicenses. Expect Alpesh to regularly contribute to RAN monthlydashboard. Tools like Arieso needs to be further explored to improvelevel of analysis and circle insight.Alpesh has worked with other major operators in the previousorganisation. He must seek best practises from outside business andsuggest fine-tuning present planning processes. U900 rollout and LTEintroduction are good platforms to make a difference. I expect him tomanage stressful situations with confidence. Alpesh to articulate histhoughts in a simplistic way to ensure message is deliveredappropriately. Adopt something which is right and make a progress aheadin a project/assignment. Orissa prediction cross check is critical formproject success point of view and same needs to properly prioritised inproject action register."
"Overall Appreciation for performance in last 12 months:Pankaj has worked quite hard and sincerely to get EAI demands throughand completed the learning curve regarding the EAI setup in VIL within3 months of joining. He has been handling end to end projects withprogressively reduced need of hand holding and intervention. He is alsocontributing quite well to the CR competency created in ADM. He isquite proactive in his communication to all stakeholders. He is alsocontributing from a strategic perspective in setting up EAI standards.He needs to focus a bit on getting things to closure and I feel he willbe able to address this quite commendably by Sep '15. Also, needs toreduce his reliance on emails.Hits vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:FTR & OTD targets set of Pankaj on the EAI deliveries aspect have beenmet. Near ZERO defects have been found in his projects which augurswell for the portfolio.He has been involved in EAI deliveries for mPesa, Enterprise CRM andDigital simplicity.He also helped in UPSS Alternate technology deployments by being presentin person during cutover.Pankaj has also contributed well in ensuring the regularity of EAIweekly portfolio meetings with the vendor so that seamless delivery ismaintained.He is also quite active in suggesting and implementing tools forcollaboration from the EAI end.He is also quite active in going through the trainings available onHarvard Business Mentor and Technology academyMisses vs Target on ""What"" aspect of performance:He has been facing escalations in terms of SIT/UAT alignments withcertain stakeholders during project execution where in it was requiredto step in and resolve matters on his behalf.Teams kept on asking for support and their issues were not resolved for3 weeks is a miss from his end e.g. CPOS.Needs to be a focus area for him during the coming year.Certain demands should have been rejected outright instead of proceedingwith them e.g.DM7605. He needs to be pro-active in this aspect of hiswork.Hits on ""How"" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):He has gone the extra mile and beyond scope of EAI to help out in CPOSissues during m-Pesa UAT. Pankaj gets involved from a technicalstandpoint as well which helps him in getting the issues resolvedfaster between partner teams. His PMP has helped him in getting properstakeholder alignment for projects being delivered by him. By beingregular in the EAI portfolio meetings, it has helped him to anticipatemost of the problems beforehand.Misses on ""How"" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Pankaj sometimes commits on things which later get hung on him likeShare@Once production testing to name one. His reliance on emailsrather than picking up the phone and discussing with the concernedparty sometimes ends up in incorrect perception of the work being doneby the portfolio. While extending support, he needs to ensure that hedefines the scope of the help and goes towards closure e.g. IVR SSLissue in mPesa.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Drive issues towards closure quickly and not keep them hanging about.Reduce his reliance on emails and work toward quicker resolution ofproblems/issues as and when they arise.Needs to work a bit differently with the vendor teams and internal ITteams to get work done in a more congenial manner.Needs to increase his participation on the solutioning and initiationphases of the projects rather than simply pick them up in G3.Progress on Development Goals:Quite satisfied with the current progress but needs to focus onfinishing things.From the look of it, he is aiming at doing too many things at the sametime. MBA/PMP/ITIL all at the same time.Progress on Career Aspirations:He has started handling projects end to end with quite reduced handholding.
